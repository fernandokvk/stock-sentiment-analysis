        "text": "Jen-Hsun Huang, president and chief executive officer of Nvidia Corp., holds a Nvidia Volta 125 Teraflops per second (TFLOPS) Tensor Core as he speaks during an event at the 2018 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S., on Sunday, Jan. 7, 2018.\n\nNvidia shares tumbled 18.8 percent at Friday's close after missing on revenue and guidance in its third-quarter 2019 earnings report.\n\nThe company missed analyst revenue expectations of $3.24 billion per Refinitiv, with the company recording $3.18 billion for the quarter. Guidance for the fourth quarter was $2.70 billion, plus or minus 2 percent, excluding certain items. That compares with the Refinitiv consensus estimate of $3.40 billion.\n\nSurplus inventory weighed heavily on the company's fourth-quarter guidance. On a call with analysts following the report Thursday, CEO Jensen Huang said it could take up to two quarters to move through the additional inventory.\n\n\"Our Q4 outlook for gaming reflects very little shipment in the midrange Pascal segment to allow channel inventory to normalize,\" Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said on the call. Revenue for Nvidia's biggest segment, gaming, fell below the $1.89 billion FactSet consensus estimate, coming in at just $1.76 billion for the quarter.\n\nIn notes Friday, analysts expressed varying degrees of concern over the excess inventory, with some saying it would be a temporary problem. Others, such as Wells Fargo, said \"investors will be frustrated\":\n\n\"While we can appreciate that NVIDIA's weak F4Q19 outlook is impacted by a 1-2 quarter work-down of Pascal mid-range gaming card inventory in the channel (~$600M; assuming no sell-in in F4Q19 as crypto-related dynamics flush through the channel), coupled with a seasonal decline in game console builds, we think investors will be frustrated by NVIDIA's comments exiting F2Q19 that: '\u2026we [NVIDIA] see inventory at the lower-ends of our stack\u2026inventory is well positioned for back-to-school and building season that's coming up on F3Q19\u2026' \"\n\nSusquehanna, which had predicted a decline in Nvidia's cryptocurrency-related revenue, said the weak revenue and guidance \"appears significantly larger than our sizable expectation.\" In the segment containing crypto-related revenue, Nvidia reported a 23 percent year-over-year decline at $148 million, which still beat the FactSet consensus estimate of $102 million. The firm reduced its price target estimates from $230 to $210.\n\n\"While we have been the crypto-GPU bears on the Street, admittedly we were not patient enough to let this unwind fully play out, and may have also underestimated the size of this Ethereum GPU bubble,\" Susquehanna wrote. \"That said, we are long-term bulls on NVDA as we believe in the A.I. inference opportunity, pro-viz upgrade cycle and 7nm refresh coming this fall. While NVDA's report was unexpectedly bad, there is one thing we know\u2026 AMD will likely be worse.\"\n\nNvidia's revenue and guidance miss appears to have an effect on one of its closest competitors in the computer chip space, Advanced Micro Devices. AMD also closed down 3.9 percent Friday.\n\n\u2014 CNBC's Jordan Novet contributed to this report."

The supernatural action game supports graphics cards with ray tracing, which enables realistic lighting effects. Android Central notes, though, that it may look still inferior to the Xbox One version, because its video quality is capped at 1080p.\n\nGeForce Now users can also play Arma 2: Operation Arrowhead, Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc, Dungeons 3, Headsnatchers, IL-2 Sturmovik: Battle of Stalingrad, Jagged Alliance 2 - Wildfire and The Guild 3 through the service. In addition, NVIDIA said that users can look forward to seeing more games added to the platform every Thursday.\n\nThis is one of the first positive developments for NVIDIA's game streaming service in a while. It has lost access to a huge list of games since it went live for all users in February. Activision Blizzard pulled all its games from the platform, including Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, Overwatch and World of Warcraft a few days after it launched. Bethesda followed soon after, which means GeForce Now also lost access to titles like Skyrim, Fallout and The Elder Scrolls. Borderlands, Civilization, BioShock, XCOM and 2K Games' other franchises left the platform earlier this month, as well."

        "text": "OAKLAND, Calif., Nov 7 (Reuters) - U.S. chip maker Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) is offering a new advanced chip in China that meets recent export control rules aimed at keeping cutting-edge technology out of China's hands, the company confirmed on Monday.\n\nNvidia responded to Reuters' reporting that Chinese computer sellers are advertising products with the new chip.\n\nThe chip, called the A800, represents the first reported effort by a U.S. semiconductor company to create advanced processors for China that follow new U.S. trade rules. Nvidia has said the export limitations could cost it hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue.\n\nU.S. regulations set in early October effectively banned export of advanced microchips and equipment to produce advanced chips by Chinese chipmakers, part of an effort to hobble China's semiconductor industry and in turn the military.\n\nIn late August, Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.O both said that their advanced chips, including Nvidia's data center chip A100, were added to the export control list by the U.S. Commerce Department. The Nvidia A800 can be used in place of the A100 and both are GPUs, or graphics processing units.\n\nSuch advanced chips can cost thousands of dollars each.\n\n\"The Nvidia A800 GPU, which went into production in Q3, is another alternative product to the Nvidia A100 GPU for customers in China. The A800 meets the U.S. Government\u2019s clear test for reduced export control and cannot be programmed to exceed it,\" a Nvidia spokesperson said in a statement to Reuters.\n\nThe logo of technology company Nvidia is seen at its headquarters in Santa Clara, California February 11, 2015. REUTERS/Robert Galbraith/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nNvidia declined comment on whether it consulted the Commerce Department about the new chip. A Commerce Department spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nAt least two Chinese websites by major server makers offer the A800 chip in their products. One of those products previously used the A100 chip in promotional material.\n\nA distributor website in China detailed the specifications of the A800. A comparison of the chip capabilities with the A100 shows that the chip-to-chip data transfer rate is 400 gigabytes per second on the new chip, down from 600 gigabytes per second on the A100. The new rules restrict rates of 600 gigabytes per second and up.\n\n\u201cThe A800 looks to be a repackaged A100 GPU designed to avoid the recent Commerce Department trade restrictions,\u201d said Wayne Lam, an analyst at CCS Insight, basing his comments on the specs shared by Reuters, and noting that eight is a lucky number in China.\n\n\"China is a significant market for Nvidia and it makes ample business sense to reconfigure your product to avoid trade restrictions,\u201d said Lam.\n\nLam said the chip-to-chip communications abilities of the A800 represented a clear performance downgrade for a data center where thousands of chips are used together.\n\nMajor Chinese server makers Inspur and H3C which offer servers with the new chips did not respond to requests for comment. Neither did chip distributor OmniSky, which posted the A800 specs online.\n\nNvidia has said that about $400 million worth of chip sales to China could be impacted in its fiscal third quarter ended in October due to the limits on high-end chips. Having a replacement chip could help lessen the financial blow. The company is to report quarterly results on Nov. 16.\n\nReporting by Jane Lanhee Lee in Oakland, Calif.

Nvidia declined to say how much the deal is worth, but industry sources said each A100 chip is priced at about $10,000 to $12,000, and the H100 is far more expensive than that.\n\n\u201cWe're at that inflection point where AI is coming to the enterprise and getting those services out there that customers can use to deploy AI for business use cases is becoming real,\u201d Ian Buck, Nvidia\u2019s general manager for Hyperscale and HPC told Reuters. \u201cWe're seeing a broad groundswell of AI adoption ... and the need for applying AI for enterprise use cases.\u201d\n\nIn addition to selling Microsoft the chips, Nvidia said it will partner with the software and cloud giant to develop AI models. Buck said Nvidia would also be a customer of Microsoft\u2019s AI cloud computer and develop AI applications on it to offer services to customers.\n\nThe rapid growth of AI models such as those used for natural language processing have sharply boosted demand for faster, more powerful computing infrastructure.\n\nNvidia said Azure would be the first public cloud to use its Quantum-2 InfiniBand networking technology which has a speed of 400 gigabits per second. That networking technology links servers at high speed.

REUTERS/Robert Galbraith/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nNov 16 (Reuters) - Chip designer and computing firm Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) beat expectations for third-quarter revenue on Wednesday, thanks to strong demand in its data center business on the back of rising cloud adoption.\n\nData center revenue in the third quarter rose 31% from a year ago, while gaming revenue was down 51% from a year ago. Nvidia shares rose 1% in after-hours trading.\n\nCloud companies are increasingly using Nvidia chips in their systems. Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) is working with the company to build a \"massive\" computer to handle intense artificial intelligence computing work in the cloud. read more\n\nAs of August, Nvidia's market share of so-called accelerator chips inside the world's six biggest clouds' infrastructure grew to 85%, brokerage Jefferies said in a note in October. read more\n\nWhile U.S. export restrictions have been a cause for worry, Nvidia's production of a downgraded iteration of the A100, called A800, which complies with recent export control rules, has been a bright spot as it helped lessen the financial blow. read more\n\nAnd Nvidia Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said while the export restrictions impacted third-quarter revenue, the decline was \"largely offset by sales of alternative products into China.\"\n\n\"The export restriction put on by the U.S. Department of Commerce was a blessing for Nvidia as Chinese customers started to hoard its Datacenter GPUs,\" said Summit Insights Group analyst Kinngai Chan, who upgraded the stock to \"buy\" from \"hold\".\n\nWhile the A800 chip meets the export regulations for China, asked if it also met the spirit of the regulations, Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang said \"it meets the clear test in letter and spirit\".\n\nThere have been questions by chip industry executives on whether Nvidia had cleared the changes with the Commerce Department. Nvidia previously declined to comment on that issue.\n\nNvidia's gaming business, a segment that once drove its revenue, was hit by weak consumer demand, but also a change in the way Ethereum crypto currency is created.\n\n\"This may have contributed to increased after-market sales of our GPUs in certain markets, potentially impacting demand for some of our products, particularly in the low-end,\" Kress said.\n\nNvidia's GPU chips have been popular for mining crypto currencies but a crypto market rout is also hurting demand. CEO Huang said that going forward he does not expect blockchain to be an important part of the business.\n\nThe company's adjusted revenue for the quarter ended Oct. 30 was $5.93 billion. Analysts on average had expected revenue of $5.77 billion, according to Refinitiv data.\n\nNvidia forecast current-quarter revenue at $6 billion, plus or minus 2%, versus expectation of $6.09 billion.\n\nReporting by Chavi Mehta in Bengaluru and Jane Lanhee Lee in Oakland, Calif.; Editing by Maju Samuel, Richard Chang and Stephen Coates\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

But with consumers returning to their pre-pandemic lives, demand for chips has declined, and prices have dropped to normal levels.\n\nNvidia is also working to ensure that it can still sell its high-end products in China. Nvidia began offering its new A800 chip in the country during Q3 as a replacement for the A100 chip, which the U.S. government said was too powerful to ship to China. The government fears China will use the technology for military applications.\n\nAhead of its earnings on Wednesday, Nvidia announced a partnership with Microsoft (MSFT) to build one of the most powerful AI supercomputers in the world using Nvidia\u2019s chips and Microsoft\u2019s Azure infrastructure.

In the third quarter, the fund declined 2.38% (Institutional Shares) compared to a 3.37% decline for the Russell 3000 Growth Index and a 4.88% decline for the S&P 500 Index. The fund fell sharply for the year-to-date and trailing 12-month periods; however, the philosophy of the fund is to achieve strong long-term performance. In addition, please check the fund\u2019s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2022.\n\nBaron Funds discussed stocks like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the Q3 2022 investor letter. Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a global graphics, and compute and networking solutions provider. On October 31, 2022, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock closed at $134.97 per share. One-month return of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was 2.51% and its shares lost 48.88% of their value over the last 52 weeks. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has a market capitalization of $336.345 billion.\n\nHere is what Baron Funds specifically said about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:\n\n\"NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a fabless semiconductor company and a leader in gaming and accelerated computing. NVIDIA is powering the growth of AI from the data center to the edge. Shares detracted due to inventory right sizing in NVIDIA\u2019s gaming segment coupled with the broader market sell-off in growth stocks. Given NVIDIA\u2019s end-to-end AI platform and its leading market share in gaming, data centers, and autonomous machines, along with the size of these markets, we believe the company can sustain its growth trajectory. See further discussion of NVIDIA in the top net purchases section below. During the third quarter, we took advantage of its stock sell-off to add to NVIDIA Corporation, a fabless semiconductor mega cap that is a global leader in gaming cards and accelerated computing hardware and software. The sell-off was driven by a near-term inventory correction in gaming as a result of a COVID-related pull forward in demand as well as the shift in the Ethereum cryptocurrency from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. Additionally, investors are concerned over the potential slowdown in data center revenues as a result of a weaker macroeconomic environment as well as the recently announced limitations on semiconductor shipments to China. Despite the near-term uncertainty, we believe that NVIDIA\u2019s end-to-end AI platform and its leading market share in gaming, data centers, and autonomous machines, along with the size of these markets, would enable the company to benefit from durable growth for years to come and therefore view the stock price where we added shares as a compelling value for long-term investors. With demand for computing power doubling every one to two years, and Moore\u2019s Law slowing down, there is more need for computing than ever. At the same time, \u201cnear free\u201d supply growth (that was possible thanks to Moore\u2019s Law) has slowed dramatically.

        "publish_date": "10/29/2022",
        "text": "For beginners, it can seem like a good idea (and an exciting prospect) to buy a company that tells a good story to investors, even if it currently lacks a track record of revenue and profit. But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.\n\nIf this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for NVIDIA\n\nHow Fast Is NVIDIA Growing?\n\nIf you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. NVIDIA's shareholders have have plenty to be happy about as their annual EPS growth for the last 3 years was 41%. While that sort of growth rate isn't sustainable for long, it certainly catches the eye of prospective investors.\n\nIt's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. While NVIDIA did well to grow revenue over the last year, EBIT margins were dampened at the same time. So if EBIT margins can stabilize, this top-line growth should pay off for shareholders.\n\nYou can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. For finer detail, click on the image.\n\nYou don't drive with your eyes on the rear-view mirror, so you might be more interested in this free report showing analyst forecasts for NVIDIA's future profits.\n\nStory continues\n\nAre NVIDIA Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\n\nOwing to the size of NVIDIA, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$14b. Investors will appreciate management having this amount of skin in the game as it shows their commitment to the company's future.\n\nShould You Add NVIDIA To Your Watchlist?\n\nNVIDIA's earnings have taken off in quite an impressive fashion. This level of EPS growth does wonders for attracting investment, and the large insider investment in the company is just the cherry on top. The hope is, of course, that the strong growth marks a fundamental improvement in the business economics. So based on this quick analysis, we do think it's worth considering NVIDIA for a spot on your watchlist. It's still necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk. We've identified 1 warning sign with NVIDIA , and understanding it should be part of your investment process.\n\nThere's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares.

That's why, in light of the recent market volatility and the growing belief that we may be nearing the end of the current bear market, I decided to take another look at this stock to see whether it has finally fallen into value territory. Historically, bear markets have been associated with strong gains for long-term investors, as those focused on value know when to seek out bargains in the shape of unfairly beaten-down stocks.\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia has a reputation for producing high-quality GPUs that can be found in a wide range of devices, from video game consoles to personal computers. Its GPUs are known for their superior performance and cutting-edge technology, making them popular among gamers and other tech enthusiasts.\n\nBut Nvidia's success as an investment goes beyond its products. Not all good companies are good investments, after all. Over the years, Nvidia has become a great stock from the perspective of investors thanks to its strong track record of delivering value to shareholders.\n\nBecause of its success as a supplier to PC gamers and high-end computer owners, which give it high margins, Nvidia has been one of the strongest performers in the semiconductor industry over the past five years.\n\nHowever, in recent months, Nvidia's stock has cratered alongside the broader market. It is not that Nvidia is doing anything wrong, but external market influences have negatively affected share prices. Additionally, with the semiconductor shortage easing up, investor sentiment is cooling further on the sector.\n\nNvidia Is Affordable for the First Time in Years\n\nDespite these challenges, Nvidia remains a key player in the tech scene, with strong innovation and a resilient track record. Whether its stock performance can rebound in the coming months remains to be seen, but one thing is clear to me: I believe Nvidia will continue to play an integral role in shaping our digital future, giving it strong long-term potential.\n\nStory continues\n\nExternal factors finally take down Nvidia's valuation\n\nNvidia has long been renowned as one of the leading companies in the semiconductor sector thanks to its dominance in several key markets, namely gaming and artificial intelligence. With each year, Nvidia's technologies have continued to evolve and expand, becoming an indispensable part of our everyday lives. Despite periodic volatility in the broader markets, Nvidia's shares have consistently traded at a significant premium, reflecting investors' confidence in this pioneering company.\n\nNvidia Is Affordable for the First Time in Years\n\nBut over the past year, Nvidia has faced increasingly challenging conditions. Several economic factors, including rising interest rates and inflation, have taken a toll on the company's valuation, causing Nvidia's stock price to fall dramatically.\n\nIt's not all related to valuation. Weak demand for PCs has negatively impacted Nvidia's revenue streams, as this has been one of the company's key markets. Additionally, Nvidia has been facing restrictions on its sales of data center chips to China due to the ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China.\n\nFinally, there are concerns about Nvidia's dominance in the hotly-contested data center chip market, with many analysts worried that Nvidia may face renewed competition from the market's largest player Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) as it supposedly begins getting its act together. All these factors combined have contributed to Nvidia's poor performance in recent months.\n\nNvidia will flourish due to several high-growth segments\n\nDespite facing significant challenges this year, Nvidia remains a force to be reckoned with in the highly competitive tech industry. Nvidia has always been cutting-edge regarding graphics processing and computer simulation innovations, and this technological prowess has kept it ahead of the competition for many years. Furthermore, Nvidia still holds an impressive market share in industries like gaming and virtual reality, both of which are poised for continued growth into the foreseeable future.\n\nNvidia is currently the leading manufacturer of graphics processing units for PCs, laptops and gaming consoles. It holds an 80% share of the global GPU market and is expected to maintain its dominance in the coming years.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2022, PC sales fell by 19.5% according to Gartner, which is the largest drop in sales since the research company began collecting sales data in the mid-1990s. However, in the long run, things will get better. According to Report Ocean, PC sales are projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 14.9% between 2021 and 2027, and Nvidia is expected to benefit from this growth.\n\nNvidia has also been at the forefront of artificial intelligence technology. Nvidia has created powerful machine-learning systems that can process vast amounts of data with incredible speed and accuracy. Thanks to Nvidia's innovations, companies and organizations across a wide range of industries have been able to leverage the power of AI to transform their workflows and improve their outputs. Whether it's improving health care diagnoses, optimizing supply chains or creating new virtual reality experiences, Nvidia continues to push the boundaries of what's possible with AI.\n\nAdditionally, Nvidia is poised for growth in the data center sector, which is experiencing strong demand for its high-end accelerators for artificial intelligence and machine learning applications.\n\nAnd finally, Nvidia's foray into self-driving car technologies is a moonshot that could prove to be a massive new source of growth over the long term as both automakers and tech companies race to make autonomous vehicles a reality.\n\nTakeaway\n\nNvidia is one of the leading companies in the fast-growing fields of PC graphics, gaming and artificial intelligence. Over the past few months, its growth has been somewhat limited due to a sluggish PC market and the easing of the chip shortage, as well as several macroeconomic factors. But despite the current challenges, Nvidia remains well-positioned for the long run with its strong brand and dominant position in all of its key markets.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n"

Two other companies, Tesla and Meta Platforms, have in the past eclipsed the $1 trillion level, but are currently worth less than that.\n\nFROM GAMING TO AI: NVIDIA'S FOCUS SHIFT\n\nNvidia, known for its chips used in videogames, pivoted to the data center market over the last few years.\n\nThe company's business rapidly expanded during the pandemic when gaming took off, cloud adoption surged and crypto enthusiasts turned to its chips for mining coins.\n\nThe data center chip business accounted for more than 50% of the company's revenue in the financial year ended Jan. 29.\n\nWHY IS GENERATIVE AI A HOT TOPIC?\n\nViral chatbot ChatGPT has made generative AI a buzzword this year. The technology uses vast troves of pre-existing data to create new content ranging from poems to images and even computer code.\n\n[1/2]The logo of NVIDIA as seen at its corporate headquarters in Santa Clara, California, in May of 2022.

MANDATORY CREDIT/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nMicrosoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Alphabet Inc-owned (GOOGL.O) Google, two of the biggest players in the space, believe that generative AI can change how work is done. The two have raced to add the technology to their search engines and productivity software as they seek to dominate the industry.\n\nMore recently, chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O) released details on its new AI chip to try to challenge Nvidia's market share.\n\nGoldman Sachs analysts estimate that U.S. investment in AI could approach 1% of the country's economic output by 2030.\n\nWHAT IS NVIDIA'S ROLE IN THE AI BOOM?\n\nThe large computers that process data and power generative AI run on powerful chips called graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\nNvidia controls about 80% of the GPU market, according to analysts.\n\nGPUs are designed to handle the specific kind of math involved in AI computing very efficiently. By contrast, generic central processing units from companies like Intel handle a broader range of computing tasks with less efficiency.\n\nOpenAI's ChatGPT, for example, was created with thousands of Nvidia GPUs.

        "text": "A smartphone with a displayed NVIDIA logo is placed on a computer motherboard in this illustration taken March 6, 2023. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration (Dado Ruvic / reuters)\n\nSAN FRANCISCO - You may not have heard about Nvidia, but thanks to the artificial intelligence boom it's now one of the most valuable companies in history.\n\nThe company has for years made the computer chips that can run graphics-heavy video games. But several years ago, artificial intelligence researchers began using those same chips to run the powerful new algorithms that were causing breakthroughs in the field.\n\nSubscribe to The Post Most newsletter for the most important and interesting stories from The Washington Post.\n\nThis week the company reported earnings and explained the incredible surge in demand it has seen as the tech world races to create new versions of AI - prompting potentially the largest one-day increase in a company's value, ever.\n\nThe 24 percent rise in stock price means Nvidia is now worth $939.3 billion. That's more than Tesla and Facebook, which are worth $584.7 billion and $647.6 billion, respectively. And it sits just behind the Big Tech companies of Apple, Google, Microsoft and Amazon and Saudi state oil giant Saudi Aramco - the only companies more valuable.\n\nNvidia began in 1993 as the brainchild of three computer chip engineers, who predicted that as computers developed, they would need to get better at processing complex visuals. The bet paid off, and by the early 2000s, the company had won a contract to make chips for Microsoft's Xbox gaming console. Since then, Nvidia has continued to grow as the video game market has exploded and eclipsed the film, television and music industries in sheer size and value.\n\nBut the current boom has come as Big Tech companies and start-ups alike scramble to buy the company's graphics processing units, or GPU chips, for a totally different reason. The chips are well-suited to crunching the massive amounts of data that are necessary to train cutting-edge artificial intelligence programs like Google's PaLM 2 or OpenAI's GPT4. Nvidia has been steadily growing its AI-focused business over the past several years, but the explosion of interest and investment in the space over the past six months has turbocharged its sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nTraining AI models demands chips that have high amounts of memory, said Greg Osuri, the founder of Akash Networks, a marketplace for companies to sell access to their GPUs to other firms that need it. \"Nvidia happens to be the only company that makes those chips.\"\n\nFor months, start-ups trying to get into the AI race have competed with Big Tech companies for Nvidia's GPUs. At the Newcomer AI conference in March, David Luan, co-founder of AI start-up Adept Labs and a former Google and OpenAI engineer, said once an AI company figures out its business model, they need venture capital money so they can begin \"sending checks to Jensen,\" referring to Jensen Huang, Nvidia's CEO.\n\nA set of eight of the most advanced chips can cost $300,000, Osuri said. Companies buy thousands of them. Twitter owner Elon Musk recently bought about 10,000 GPUs as part of his plans to start a new AI company of his own, according to a report in Insider.\n\nThe launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT, a chatbot that could have complex conversations, pass professional licensing exams and write computer code, in November helped show the promise of the technology, essentially serving as a firing pistol for a new AI arms race.\n\nIn a conference call with investors on Wednesday, Nvidia's Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress called ChatGPT's launch the technology's \"iPhone moment,\" marking the point at which the world realized the potential for the new tech.\n\n\"The technology came together and helped everybody realize what an amazing product it can be and what capabilities it can have,\" Kress said.\n\nNvidia's stock had already more than doubled this year as the AI boom took off, but the company blew past already-high expectations on Wednesday when it forecast that sales in the second quarter would be $11 billion, compared with the $7 billion that Wall Street analysts had forecast.\n\nThe numbers \"blew everyone away,\" said CJ Muse, an analyst with Evercore Inc. \"No one saw that.\"\n\nThe dependency on Nvidia is so widespread that Big Tech companies have been working on developing their own competing chips, much in the same way as Apple spent years developing its own chips so it could avoid having to rely on - and pay - other companies to outfit its devices. Google has built its own \"Tensor Processing Units\" for several years, and both Microsoft and Amazon have programs to design their own as well.\n\nEven so, those alternatives won't be enough for the biggest companies, Muse said. \"I think Nvidia dominance will continue.\"\n\nRelated Content\n\nHow Michael Phelps learned to make the right calls\n\nA year after Uvalde, officers who botched response face few consequences\n\nObjection to sexual, LGBTQ content propels spike in book challenges"

        "text": "(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. has a knack for riding tech trends \u2014 selling graphics chips that powered everything from the video game boom to the rise of cryptocurrency and the industry\u2019s big bet on the metaverse.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBut arguably no trend stands to benefit the world\u2019s most valuable chip company more than the rise of artificial intelligence. Nvidia\u2019s 24% surge on Thursday pushed it within grasp of a $1 trillion market capitalization, a level that would rank it among the tech elite including Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be reluctant to say it has won the race, but it is winning right now,\u201d said Zeno Mercer, senior research analyst at ROBO Global.\n\nFollowing an AI-fueled sales forecast this week that blew Wall Street targets out of the water, Nvidia\u2019s value grew $184 billion on Thursday. That was the third-biggest one-day gain in market capitalization in the US ever. Nvidia climbed an additional 2.5% on Friday, putting its valuation at $963.2 billion.\n\nNvidia was co-founded in 1993 by Jensen Huang, who still runs the company. It proved more successful than its peers at developing chips that turn computer code into the realistic images that computer gamers love, and rode out a wave of consolidation that saw its rivals acquired, bankrupted or merged into larger companies.\n\nUnder Huang, the company then pushed its technology into new markets, such as data center servers and artificial intelligence processing \u2014 a move that\u2019s proving prescient today. In less than a decade, Nvidia\u2019s data center business has grown from $300 million in annual revenue to $15 billion. The chipmaker has won orders to equip giant computing factories by successfully arguing that graphics chips can handle AI workloads better than more standard processors.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company\u2019s latest forecast spotlighted that progress. Sales in the three months ending in July will be about $11 billion, Nvidia said late on Wednesday, shattering an average analyst estimate of $7.18 billion.\n\nRead More: Nvidia\u2019s Blowout Forecast Sparks Huge Rally in All Things AI\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing incredible orders to retool the world\u2019s data centers,\u201d Huang told analysts on a conference call. A trillion dollars of data center infrastructure will be upgraded to handle so-called accelerated computing, he said, letting them run generative AI tools such as ChatGPT. \u201cThe budget of a data center will shift very strongly to accelerated computing.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s become common for tech companies to talk up their artificial intelligence prospects during earnings conference calls. References to AI soared after the launch of ChatGPT in November, and they don\u2019t always spark a stock rally.\n\nBut Nvidia has now become the model of a company that\u2019s actually making money from AI. It\u2019s the seller of picks and shovels in the gold-rush analogy.\n\nAnd that\u2019s brought it to a historic threshold: Crossing $1 trillion valuation would be a first for the semiconductor industry. Even Intel Corp., a Silicon Valley pioneer and the company most synonymous with computer chips, never came close.\n\nNvidia eclipsed Intel in market capitalization in 2020, and the companies have only grown further apart. Nvidia\u2019s current valuation is eight times that of Intel, despite the company having far less revenue.\n\nNvidia\u2019s success has made investors even gloomier about Intel. While many chipmakers saw their stocks gain in the wake of Nvidia\u2019s blockbuster earnings report this week, Intel actually fell.\n\nRead More: ASML, Europe\u2019s Most Valuable Tech Firm, Defines Global Chip War\n\nNvidia is also benefiting from a broader rebound in technology spending. The chip industry is recovering from one of its periodic slumps, and many companies \u2014 even Intel \u2014 are looking for demand to improve in the second half.\n\nBut the swing will be particularly dramatic for Nvidia. It\u2019s poised to go from flat sales in the current fiscal year to a 45% gain in 2024.\n\n\u201cThey may be in a unique position,\u201d Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said on Bloomberg Television. \u201cIs it a one-time thing or is this the new normal? I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nRead More: Nvidia\u2019s $184 Billion Jump in Five Charts\n\nHuang, 60, is the longest-serving CEO of a major tech company but runs the business like a startup. He is known for making snap decisions and demanding rapid execution.\n\nHis big bets haven\u2019t always worked out. Nvidia announced plans in 2020 to acquire Arm Ltd. for $40 billion, aiming to take control of chip technology that\u2019s used in phones, factory machines and a wide range of other equipment. Huang had hoped to use Arm to bring AI to everything that has an on-off switch.\n\nBut Arm\u2019s customers opposed the deal, which would have been the largest-ever in the chip industry, fearing it would compromise the British company\u2019s neutrality. The US Federal Trade Commission sued to block the transaction in late 2021, prompting to Nvidia to walk away from the purchase in February 2022.\n\nNow, that failed deal is a distant memory for Nvidia investors. The key question these days is how quickly Nvidia\u2019s peers can cut its lead in AI. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. is working with Microsoft Corp., for instance, to ramp up its AI chip efforts.\n\n\u201cThere is a broader AI ecosystem,\u201d said ROBO Global\u2019s Mercer. \u201cWhile Nvidia will likely remain highly valued, the rest of the system will catch up.\u201d\n\n(Updates shares starting in fourth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P."

Apple's $191 billion pop in November 2022 is the current record holder.\n\nIt was Nvidia's outlook that truly surprised the investing masses.\n\nThe company expects second-quarter revenue to come in at about $11 billion, plus or minus 2%. Wall Street was anticipating $7.2 billion.\n\nNvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang told analysts on the conference call the very upbeat outlook reflects a fundamental shift to accelerated computing. In turn, that places Nvidia's chips that power generative AI in high demand.\n\n\"We're seeing incredible orders to retool the world's data centers. And so I think you're seeing the beginning of, call it, a 10-year transition to basically recycle or reclaim the world's data centers and build it out as accelerated computing,\" Huang said. \"You'll have a pretty dramatic shift in the spend of a data center from traditional computing and to accelerate computing with SmartNICs, smart switches, of course GPUs and the workload is going to be predominantly generative AI.\"\n\nHere's the vibe on Wall Street after Nvidia's big quarter and outlook.\n\nRuben Roy, Stifel (Hold rating; $370 price target, up from $300): \"Nvidia's recent momentum continued as first quarter results beat consensus expectations and the company's second quarter revenue outlook was significantly above high expectations. Nvidia remains in the sweet spot of AI-infrastructure wallet share as build outs of accelerated computing networks continue. As the company's data center numbers grow, questions on the near-term supply environment are likely to continue. For now, while not providing explicit longer-term guidance, Nvidia management noted that data center-related demand visibility has increased and that the company has procured substantially higher supply for the second half of the year. We raise our estimates and target price and continue to view Nvidia as the best positioned near-term beneficiary of CSP capex spending trends.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia Corp CEO Jensen Huang holds one of the company's new RTX 4090 chips for computer gaming in this undated handout photo provided September 20, 2022. Courtesy of Nvidia Corp/Handout via REUTERS\n\nTristan Gerra, Baird (Outperform rating, upgrade from Hold; $475 price target, up from $300): \"We raised our estimates above consensus and added a Fresh Pick designation to Nvidia on March 20 reflecting our channel feedback about strong H100 orders notably related to ChatGPT emerging in March but we failed to upgrade at that time. As AI-related order momentum continues into the second half, annualized earnings of $10 are at reach within 2-3 quarters in our view, reflected in the valuation post earnings. Our raised next two-year EPS forecast assumes continued AI-related momentum driven by two secular growth trends: continued adoption rate for parallel processing-based acceleration in data centers, and the emergence of AI models notably related to ChatGPT and LLMs [large language models], all of which require GPUs.\"\n\nAtif Malik, Citi (Buy rating; $420 price target, up from $353): \"While we had raised our target price and estimates into the earnings, Generative AI upside was bigger than we expected. Nvidia expects data center sales to roughly double in the July quarter driven by Gen AI demand from CSPs, consumer internet companies, and accelerated computing in enterprises. Nvidia estimates only ~4% of the $1 trillion data center CPU installed base over the last four years has been GPU accelerated, implying AI adoption remains in early innings.\"\n\nDan Ives, Wedbush (no rating/price target): \"There is not one better indicator around underlying AI demand going on in the hyperscale/cloud and overall enterprise market than the foundational Nvidia story. We view Nvidia at the core hearts and lungs of the AI revolution given its core chips train and deploy generative AI applications like ChatGPT. The Street was all awaiting last night's Nvidia quarter and guidance to gauge the magnitude of this AI demand story with many skeptics saying an AI bubble was forming and instead Jensen & Co. delivered guidance for the ages.\"\n\nRoss Seymore, Deutsche Bank (Hold rating; $390 price target, up from $170): \"After such a massive beat/raise/share price pop, the key question going forward is sustainability. We believe the drivers of it appear to be much more secular than cyclical (AI, DC accelerators crowding out CPUs, etc.), and Nvidia's lead in this market remains sizable, but we remain uncertain as to the pace of such growth post second quarter and if/when the next DC digestion period may occur. Consequently, we are raising our 2024 revenue/EPS by a significant +37%/+70%, with our price target rising to $390 (based upon a consistent 40x P/E multiple). With Nvidia's unique AI market leadership and the scarcity of alternative plays, we see little that could diminish investor optimism and recommend continuing to enjoy the ride.\"\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "title": "If You Invested $1000 in Nvidia a Decade Ago, This is How Much It'd Be Worth Now",
        "publish_date": "05/24/2023",
        "text": "How much a stock's price changes over time is important for most investors, since price performance can both impact your investment portfolio and help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.\n\nThe fear of missing out, or FOMO, also plays a factor in investing, especially with particular tech giants, as well as popular consumer-facing stocks.\n\nWhat if you'd invested in Nvidia (NVDA) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to NVDA for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?\n\nNvidia's Business In-Depth\n\nWith that in mind, let's take a look at Nvidia's main business drivers.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU. Over the years, the company\u2019s focus has evolved from PC graphics to artificial intelligence (AI) based solutions that now support high performance computing (HPC), gaming and virtual reality (VR) platforms.\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s GPU success can be attributed to its parallel processing capabilities supported by thousands of computing cores, which are necessary to run deep learning algorithms. The company\u2019s GPU platforms are playing a major role in developing multi-billion-dollar end-markets like robotics and self-driving vehicles.\n\n\n\nNVIDIA is a dominant name in the Data Center, professional visualization and gaming markets where Intel and Advanced Micro Devices are playing a catch-up role. The company\u2019s partnership with almost all major cloud service providers (CSPs) and server vendors is a key catalyst.\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s GPUs are also getting rapid adoption in diverse fields ranging from radiology to precision agriculture. The company\u2019s GPUs power the top two supercomputers in the world, located at Oak Ridge and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories in the United States, as well as the top supercomputers in Europe and Japan. In all, NVIDIA powers 136 of the TOP500 supercomputers.\n\n\n\nSanta Clara, CA-based, NVIDIA reported revenues of $26.97 billion in fiscal 2023, slightly up from $26.91 billion in fiscal 2022.\n\n\n\nBeginning first-quarter fiscal 2021, NVIDIA started reporting revenues under two segments \u2013 Graphics and Compute & Networking.\n\n\n\nGraphics includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related infrastructure, and solutions for gaming platforms; Quadro GPUs for enterprise design; GRID software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing; and automotive platforms for infotainment systems.\n\n\n\nCompute & Networking comprises Data Center platforms and systems for AI, HPC, and accelerated computing; DRIVE for autonomous vehicles; and Jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms. Mellanox revenues included in this segment beginning second-quarter fiscal 2021.\n\n\n\nGraphics and Compute & Networking accounted for 44% and 56% of fiscal 2023 revenues, respectively.\n\nStory continues\n\nBottom Line\n\nPutting together a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of research, patience, and a little bit of risk. For Nvidia, if you bought shares a decade ago, you're likely feeling really good about your investment today.\n\nAccording to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in May 2013 would be worth $83,904.31, or an 8,290.43% gain, as of May 24, 2023. Investors should keep in mind that this return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.\n\nIn comparison, the S&P 500 gained 151.17% and the price of gold went up 36.27% over the same time frame.\n\nLooking ahead, analysts are expecting more upside for NVDA.\n\nNVIDIA is gaining from strong growth of artificial intelligence, high-performance computing and accelerated computing, which is boosting its Compute & Networking revenues. A surge in Hyperscale demand and a solid uptake of artificial intelligence-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions are acting as tailwinds. Collaboration with Mercedes-Benz and Audi is likely to advance its presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. We expect its Automotive segment\u2019s revenue to grow at a CAGR of 31.9% through fiscal 2023-2025. However, NVDA\u2019s near-term prospects look gloomy due to weakening demand for chips used in gaming and data center end markets. While macroeconomic headwinds are impacting gaming and data center chip demand, higher channel inventory levels are hurting chip prices.\n\nThe stock is up 16.95% over the past four weeks, and no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 3 higher, for fiscal 2023. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "publish_date": "05/25/2023",
        "text": "Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) rocketed more than 26% on Thursday, as the graphics chip maker rides the generative AI explosion. The rip higher comes after the company reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings Wednesday, and pointed to a dramatic acceleration in data center revenue in the current quarter.\n\nNvidia is the leading AI chip maker thanks to years of investments in AI technologies. And according to Raymond James managing director Srini Pajjuri, the company isn\u2019t going to lose that title anytime soon.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only one supplier of GPUs, and Nvidia has been investing in this market for the last 10 years. They not only have the chips, they have the systems, the software, it\u2019s a full stack solutions company,\u201d explained Pajjuri.\n\n\u201cIn the short term, Nvidia is the only game in town,\u201d he said.\n\nNvidia beat analysts\u2019 expectations on the top and bottom line in Q1 thanks to its data center business, which brought in $4.2 billion in revenue versus the $3.9 billion Wall Street was anticipating. That was better than the same quarter last year when the company reported data center revenue of $3.8 billion.\n\nNvidia\u2019s gaming business, meanwhile, continues to deal with a COVID hangover, as consumers continue to pull back on spending on PCs and graphics cards after buying them up during the pandemic.\n\nThe segment brought in $2.2 billion, which was better than the $1.9 billion Wall Street expected, but lower than the $3.6 billion the company reported in Q1 last year.\n\nSign up for the Yahoo Finance newsletter.\n\nBut it\u2019s Nvidia\u2019s projections for the second quarter that have caught Wall Street\u2019s attention. The company says it expects revenue of $11 billion, plus or minus 2%. Wall Street was looking for $7.2 billion.\n\n\u201cWe thought if they beat the guidance by about 5%, that\u2019s good enough for the stock to stay where it is. But they\u2019re beating [the] guidance consensus by 50%,\u201d Pajjuri said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a war going on out there in AI, and Nvidia today is the only arms dealer out there. So as a result we\u2019re seeing this huge jump in revenues,\u201d he explained.\n\nStory continues\n\nBaird Equity Research senior research analyst Tristan Gerra echoed those sentiments in an investor note Thursday saying while platforms like Google\u2019s (GOOG, GOOGL) next-generation tensor processing unit could be competitive, it is unlikely to take market share from Nvidia.\n\nNvidia reported better than expected Q1 earnings on Wednesday. Courtesy NVIDIA/Handout via REUTERS\n\n\u201cWe see nobody with a full-stack solution remotely matching Nvidia\u2019s capabilities,\u201d Gerra wrote.\n\nBut the AI gold rush won\u2019t last forever for Nvidia. According to Pajjuri, long-time Nvidia rival AMD (AMD) could eventually begin to capture market share. Companies designing their own custom chips could also put the kibosh on Nvidia\u2019s party.\n\n\u201cNvidia\u2019s chips today sell for $25,000 a piece,\u201d he said. \u201cBy designing the chips in house, you can reduce the cost pretty significantly.\u201d\n\nThe current explosion in AI kicked off when OpenAI released its generative AI chatbot ChatGPT last year. Since then Microsoft and Google have jumped into the arena with search engines, bots, and more running powered by generative AI.\n\nThe category\u2019s unprecedented growth has also drawn the attention of lawmakers who are looking at ways of potentially regulating the technology.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "text": "The logo of technology company Nvidia is seen at its headquarters in Santa Clara, California February 11, 2015. REUTERS/Robert Galbraith Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nNEW YORK, May 30 (Reuters) - Nvidia Corp's (NVDA.O) debut in the club of U.S. companies valued at $1 trillion on Tuesday may have given a boost to a number of portfolio managers who bought in to the stock, according to data revealed in first-quarter hedge fund filings, such as Australia listed boutique investment firm GQG Partners.\n\nQuarterly securities filings known as 13-Fs are backward- looking but show what funds owned on the last day of the quarter and are one of the few ways that hedge funds and other institutional investors have to declare their positions. They may not reflect current holdings, as fund managers may have added or sold shares since then.\n\nMany investors have piled in to the chipmaker that has quickly become one of the biggest winners of the AI boom. Nvidia's gains have also been boosted by the company's update on revenue forecast last week, which surpassed the mean Wall Street estimate by more the 50%.\n\nAmong the biggest potential winners are Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based, Australia-listed investment firm GQG Partners Inc , which added 8.2 million shares in Nvidia Corp in the first quarter, according to a regulatory filing.\n\nThe stake, acquired for $2.3 billion, is now worth $3.3 billion or roughly 45% more. In the previous quarter, Nvidia was not part of GQG's portfolio.\n\nGQG, which earlier this year invested in shares of India's Adani group, did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.\n\nTiger Global Management, Wellington Management Group and Moore Capital are also among the investors that added shares of Nvidia in the first quarter, ahead of its 45% price jump from April 3 through Tuesday.\n\nAmong prominent investors who sold Nvidia's shares before its recent jump is ARK Invest. ARK CEO Cathie Wood said in a tweet that the shares' current valuation seems to imply Nvidia does not have competitors. \"Now up ~80-fold, investors seem to think NVDA is the only play. It is not!\" she said, adding the company is priced ahead of the curve.\n\nCalifornia Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) sold roughly 1 million shares in Nvidia, but remained with about $1.2 billion in shares in the first quarter.\n\nReporting by Carolina Mandl in New York Editing by Megan Davies and Matthew Lewis\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

        "title": "Nvidia is not the only firm cashing in on the AI gold rush",
        "publish_date": "05/29/2023",
        "text": "A GREY RECTANGULAR building on the outskirts of San Jose houses rows upon rows of blinking machines. Tangles of colourful wires connect high-end servers, networking gear and data-storage systems. Bulky air-conditioning units whirr overhead. The noise forces visitors to shout.\n\nThe building belongs to Equinix, a company which leases data-centre space. The equipment inside belongs to companies from corporate giants to startups, which are increasingly using it to run their artificial-intelligence (AI) systems. The AI gold rush, spurred by the astounding sophistication of \u201cgenerative\u201d systems such as ChatGPT, a hit virtual conversationalist, promises to generate rich profits for those who harness the technology\u2019s potential. As in the early days of any gold rush, though, it is already minting fortunes for the sellers of the requisite picks and shovels.\n\nOn May 24th Nvidia, which designs the semiconductors of choice for many AI servers, beat analysts\u2019 revenue and profit forecasts for the three months to April. It expects sales of $11bn in its current quarter, half as much again as what Wall Street was predicting. As its share price leapt by 30% the next day, the company\u2019s market value flirted with $1trn. Nvidia\u2019s chief executive, Jensen Huang, declared on May 29th that the world is at \u201cthe tipping point of a new computing era\u201d.\n\nOther chip firms, from fellow designers like AMD to manufacturers such as TSMC of Taiwan, have been swept up in the AI excitement. So have providers of other computing infrastructure\u2014which includes everything from those colourful cables, noisy air-conditioning units and data-centre floor space to the software that helps run the AI models and marshal the data. An equally weighted index of 30-odd such companies has risen by 40% since ChatGPT\u2019s launch in November, compared with 13% for the tech-heavy NASDAQ index (see chart). \u201cA new tech stack is emerging,\u201d sums up Daniel Jeffries of the AI Infrastructure Alliance, a lobby group.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the face of it, the AI gubbins seems far less exciting than the clever \u201clarge language models\u201d behind ChatGPT and its fast-expanding array of rivals. But as the model-builders and makers of applications that piggyback on those models vie for a slice of the future AI pie, they all need computing power in the here and now\u2014and lots of it.\n\nThe latest AI systems, including the generative sort, are much more computing-intensive than older ones, let alone non-AI applications. Amin Vahdat, head of AI infrastructure at Google Cloud Platform, the internet giant\u2019s cloud-computing arm, observes that model sizes have grown ten-fold each year for the past six years. GPT-4, the latest version of the one which powers ChatGPT, analyses data using perhaps 1trn parameters, more than five times as many as its predecessor. As the models grow in complexity, the computational needs for training them increase correspondingly.\n\nOnce trained, AIs require less number-crunching capacity to be used in a process called inference. But given the range of applications on offer, inference will, cumulatively, also demand plenty of processing oomph. Microsoft has more than 2,500 customers for a service that uses technology from OpenAI, ChatGPT\u2019s creator, of which the software giant owns nearly half. That is up ten-fold since the previous quarter. Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, has six products with 2bn or more users globally\u2014and plans to turbocharge them with generative AI.\n\nThe most obvious winners from surging demand for computing power are the chipmakers. Companies like Nvidia and AMD get a licence fee every time their blueprints are etched onto silicon by manufacturers such as TSMC on behalf of end-customers, notably the big providers of cloud computing that powers most AI applications. AI is thus a boon to the chip designers, since it benefits from more powerful chips (which tend to generate higher margins), and more of them. UBS, a bank, reckons that in the next one or two years AI will increase demand for specialist chips known as graphics-processing units (GPUs) by $10bn-15bn.\n\nAs a result, Nvidia\u2019s annual data-centre revenue, which accounts for 56% of its sales, could double. AMD is bringing out a new GPU later this year. Although it is a much smaller player in the GPU-design game than Nvidia, the scale of the AI boom means that the firm is poised to benefit \u201ceven if it just gets the dregs\u201d of the market, says Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein, a broker. Chip-design startups focused on AI, such as Cerebras and Graphcore, are trying to make a name for themselves. PitchBook, a data provider, counts about 300 such firms.\n\nNaturally, some of the windfall will also accrue to the manufacturers. In April TSMC\u2019s boss, C.C. Wei, talked cautiously of \u201cincremental upside in AI-related demand\u201d. Investors have been rather more enthusiastic. The company\u2019s share price rose by 10% after Nvidia\u2019s latest earnings, adding around $20bn to its market capitalisation. Less obvious beneficiaries also include companies that allow more chips to be packaged into a single processing unit. Besi, a Dutch firm, makes the tools that help bond chips together. According to Pierre Ferragu of New Street Research, another firm of analysts, the Dutch company controls three-quarters of the market for high-precision bonding. Its share price has jumped by more than half this year.\n\nUBS estimates that gpus make up about half the cost of specialised AI servers, compared with a tenth for standard servers. But they are not the only necessary gear. To work as a single computer, a data centre\u2019s GPUs also need to talk to each other.\n\nThat, in turn, requires increasingly advanced networking equipment, such as switches, routers and specialist chips. The market for such kit is expected to grow by 40% annually in the next few years, to nearly $9bn by 2027, according to 650 Group, a research firm. Nvidia, which also licenses such kit, accounts for 78% of global sales. But competitors like Arista Networks, a Californian firm, are getting a look-in from investors, too: its share price is up by nearly 70% in the past year. Broadcom, which sells specialist chips that help networks operate, said that its annual sales of such semiconductors would quadruple in 2023, to $800m.\n\nThe AI boom is also good news for companies that assemble the servers that go into data centres, notes Peter Rutten of IDC, another research firm. Dell\u2019Oro Group, one more firm of analysts, predicts that data centres across the world will increase the share of servers dedicated to AI from less than 10% today to about 20% within five years, and that kit\u2019s share of data centres\u2019 capital spending on servers will rise from about 20% today to 45%.\n\nThis will benefit server manufacturers like Wistron and Inventec, both from Taiwan, which produce custom-built servers chiefly for giant cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft\u2019s Azure. Smaller manufacturers should do well, too. The bosses of Wiwynn, another Taiwanese server-maker, recently said that AI-related projects account for more than half of their current order book. Super Micro, an American firm, said that in the three months to April AI products accounted for 29% of its sales, up from an average of 20% in the previous 12 months.\n\nAll this AI hardware requires specialist software to operate. Some of these programs come from the hardware firms; Nvidia\u2019s software platform, called CUDA, allows customers to make the most of its GPUs, for example. Other firms create applications that let AI firms manage data (Datagen, Pinecone, Scale AI) or host large language models (HuggingFace, Replicate). PitchBook counts around 80 such startups. More than 20 have raised new capital so far this year; Pinecone counts Andreessen Horowitz and Tiger Global, two giants of venture capital, as investors.\n\nAs with the hardware, the main customers for a lot of this software are the cloud giants. Together Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft plan to undertake capital spending of around $120bn this year, up from $78bn in 2022. Much of that will go to expanding their cloud capacity. Even so, demand for AI computing is so high that even they are struggling to keep up.\n\nThat has created an opening for challengers. In the past few years IBM, Nvidia and Equinix have started to offer access to GPUs \u201cas a service\u201d. AI-focused cloud startups are proliferating, too. In March one of them, Lambda, raised $44m from investors such as Gradient Ventures, one of Google\u2019s venture arms, and Greg Brockman, co-founder of OpenAI. The deal valued the firm at around $200m. A similar outfit, CoreWeave, raised $221m in April, including from Nvidia, at a valuation of $2bn. Brannin McBee, CoreWeave\u2019s co-founder, argues that a focus on customer service and infrastructure designed around AI help it compete with the cloud giants.\n\nThe last group of AI-infrastructure winners are closest to providing actual shovels: the data-centre landlords. As demand for cloud computing surges, their properties are filling up. In the second half of 2022 data-centre vacancy rates stood at 3%, a record low. Specialists such as Equinix or its rival, Digital Realty, increasingly compete with large asset managers, who are keen to add data centres to their property portfolios. In 2021 Blackstone, a private-markets giant, paid $10bn for QTS Realty Trust, one of America\u2019s biggest data-centre operators. In April Brookfield, Blackstone\u2019s Canadian rival which has been investing heavily in data centres, bought Data4, a French data-centre firm.\n\nContinued growth of the AI-infrastructure stack could yet run up against constraints. One is energy. A big investor in data centres notes that access to electricity, of which data centres are prodigious users, is expected to slow development of new data centres in hubs like northern Virginia and Silicon Valley. Another potential block is a shift away from vast AI models and cloud-based inference to smaller systems that require less computing power to train and can run inference on a smartphone, as is the case for Google\u2019s recently unveiled scaled-down version of its PaLM model.\n\nThe biggest question-mark hangs over the permanence of the AI boom itself. Despite the popularity of ChatGPT and its ilk, profitable use cases for the technology remain unclear. In Silicon Valley, hype can turn to disappointment on a dime. Nvidia\u2019s market value surged in 2021, as its GPUs turned out to be perfect for mining bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, then collapsed as the crypto boom turned to bust.\n\nAnd if the technology does live up to its transformative billing, regulators could clamp down. Policymakers around the world, worried about generative AI\u2019s potential to eliminate jobs or spread misinformation, are already mulling guardrails. Indeed, on May 11th lawmakers in the EU proposed a set of rules that would restrict chatbots.\n\nAll these limiting factors may slow AI\u2019s deployment, and in doing so dampen the prospects for AI-infrastructure firms. But probably only a bit. Even if generative AI does not turn out to be as transformative as its boosters claim, it will almost certainly be more useful than crypto. And there are plenty of other, non-generative AIs that also need lots of computing power. Nothing short of a global ban on generative AI, which is not on the horizon, is likely to stop the gold rush. And so long as everybody is rushing, the pedlars of picks and shovels will be cashing in.\n\nTo stay on top of the biggest stories in business and technology, sign up to the Bottom Line, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.\n\n\u00a9 2023 The Economist Newspaper Limited.

        "publish_date": "11/10/2021",
        "text": "Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang doesn\u2019t see the global chip shortage coming to an end anytime soon. The head of the largest chip maker by market cap, Huang is fresh off his virtual keynote at Nvidia\u2019s GTC conference where he announced advances in the company\u2019s metaverse and AI efforts.\n\nBut Nvidia still makes the bulk of its revenue, about 47% in Q2, from the sale of its gaming cards. And those continue to be in short supply due to the pandemic-induced chip crisis.\n\n\u201cI think that through the next year, demand is going to far exceed supply. We don\u2019t have any magic bullets in navigating the supply chain,\u201d Huang told Yahoo Finance Live on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe have the support of our suppliers. We\u2019re fortunate that we\u2019re multi-sourced and that our supply chain is diverse and our company is quite large so we have the support of a large ecosystem around us,\u201d he added.\n\nThe chip crisis kicked off at the start of the pandemic when automakers, expecting a slowdown in sales, cut their chip orders. But consumers had other plans and started buying up cars in droves. At the same time, consumers, trapped in their homes due to pandemic restrictions, started grabbing everything from workstations and webcams to gaming PCs and game consoles.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang speaks during a press conference at The MGM during CES 2018 in Las Vegas on January 7, 2018. / AFP PHOTO / Mandel Ngan\n\nWith so many industries vying for attention from the small number of global chip makers, a crunch was all but guaranteed. And it continues to play out now. Try buying an Nvidia graphics card or, heck, a PlayStation 5. If you don\u2019t want to pay hundreds of dollars over the manufacturer\u2019s suggested retail price, you\u2019ll likely be waiting a while.\n\nThe demand has piled up so much that when products do become available, they sell out in an instant. We\u2019re talking about people lined up in parking lots outside of electronics stores hoping to get their hands on a new Nvidia card. I\u2019ve got an Nvidia card in my own gaming computer, but was lucky enough to get it in 2019.\n\nOf course, Nvidia isn\u2019t the only company contending with the chip shortage. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger told Yahoo Finance Live last month that he doesn\u2019t expect supply problems to get better until some time in 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Huang says the chip shortage will eventually subside, he doesn\u2019t think the level of demand we\u2019re seeing is transitory. Instead, he says it\u2019s here to stay.\n\n\u201cPeople are starting to build more and more home workstations because their home is now their office,\u201d Huang said. \u201cAnd when they\u2019re at home they prefer to have a permanent system, and so desktop computers are doing incredibly well.\u201d\n\nPeople are also spending more time gaming, he said, leading to more people trying to get their hands on Nvidia\u2019s high-end graphics cards.\n\n\u201cI think these are permanent conditions, and we\u2019re going to see new computers being built for quite a while. People are building home offices, and you could see all of the implications,\u201d Huang said.\n\nSign up for Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter\n\nMore from Dan\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit\n\nGot a tip?

Get it sent directly to your inbox every Wednesday by 4 p.m. ET. Subscribe\n\nWednesday, November 11, 2021\n\nNvidia is still the graphics king, but AMD, Intel, and Apple are making moves\n\nNvidia (NVDA) unveiled a sweeping array of new technologies at its GTC conference this week, ranging from an AI-powered chauffeur that can park your car to a tool to predict the paths of wildfires. All of this from a company that started out selling graphics cards for gamers.\n\nBut Nvidia still makes the majority of its money from the sale of those cards. Its gaming unit accounted for 47% of total revenue in the second quarter, while the data center business accounted for 36%.\n\nAnd while Nvidia dominates with roughly 83% of market share compared to AMD's (AMD) 17%, it has serious competition angling to take its crown.\n\nFirst, there's Apple (AAPL), which has quickly built out its own laptop chips with graphics capabilities that it says can tangle with Nvidia\u2019s best offerings. And waiting in the wings is Intel (INTC), which is set to launch its own line of graphics chips that could prove especially troublesome for Nvidia.\n\nThat's because unlike Apple's chips, Intel's graphics processors will find their way into Windows laptops and desktops. Windows PCs are the go-to computers for gamers around the world, and if Intel pushes out chips that can rival Nvidia's capabilities, it could threaten the gaming titan in the long term.\n\nIntel, Apple, and AMD are looking to take own Nvidia\n\nNvidia is a beast in the gaming market and AI business, but it\u2019s quickly gaining new rivals. While the company\u2019s RTX cards are some of the most powerful around, they aren\u2019t the only option for consumers and businesses.\n\nJensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, shows the NVIDIA Volta GPU computing platform at his keynote address at CES in Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S. January 7, 2018. REUTERS/Rick Wilking\n\nWhile AMD doesn\u2019t have Nvidia\u2019s market share, it\u2019s got the kind of capabilities that gamers are looking for at similar prices. Intel, meanwhile, is preparing to roll out the first real competitors to mainstream Nvidia and AMD graphics in the form of its Arc Alchemist chips for laptops and desktop cards.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cIntel has already got all the support for gaming in its GPUs, because Intel is actually the biggest GPU vendor in the market with its integrated GPUs,\u201d explained Gartner analyst Alan Priestley.\n\nBut those chips, he says, don\u2019t offer the kind of graphics capabilities of discrete graphics chips that have their own memory. They\u2019re more in line with playing Solitaire rather than, say, \u201cCall of Duty.\u201d But Intel\u2019s new chips, based on its Xe-HPG microarchitecture, appear to have all of the features necessary to take on Nvidia.\n\nIntel says its chips will support technologies like DirectX Ray Tracing, variable rate shading, and mesh shading \u2014 basically all things that make games look and run well. It's taking a direct swipe at Nvidia\u2019s most important business.\n\n\u201cThe challenge for Intel is going to be whether it can gain share, because it's either got to gain share from Nvidia or AMD or grow the market,\u201d Priestley said.\n\nIntel isn\u2019t Nvidia\u2019s only new competitor. Apple has become a surprising dark horse in the graphics game with its M1 Pro and M1 Max chips. Powering the company\u2019s MacBook Pro 14-inch and MacBook Pro 16-inch, the chips make Apple\u2019s laptops, according to the company\u2019s own numbers, every bit as capable in terms of graphics performance as those running Nvidia chips.\n\nAccording to Apple\u2019s testing, the M1 Max-powered MacBook Pro 16-inch with 64GB of RAM beats out Razer\u2019s Blade 15 Advanced running an Intel Core i9, 32GB of RAM, and an Nvidia RTX 3080 in both performance and power efficiency. Both systems are roughly the same price.\n\nThere are some caveats there, of course. Namely that Apple doesn\u2019t play much in the gaming space. Sure, there are games available through the App Store, but if you\u2019re looking for AAA titles from the world\u2019s biggest developers, you\u2019ll find them on PC.\n\nIt\u2019s not just gaming where Nvidia is facing stiffer competition, though. AMD on Monday rolled out its new MI200 GPU for high performance computing and AI acceleration, with its sights set on taking on Nvidia in the data center space. Not to be left out, Intel is expected to bring out its own Ponte Vecchio GPU in 2022 for AI applications.\n\nNvidia is still as formidable as they come\n\nDespite staring down strong contenders, Nvidia is still a powerhouse \u2014 in large part because of its software.\n\n\u201cThey make their products very sticky by creating software infrastructure that makes it hard for customers to shift, particularly in the data center,\u201d explained Matt Bryson, SVP of Equity Research at Wedbush Securities. \u201cSo I really think that that is the differentiation that they've created both in gaming and in the data center space. And that it's just really hard for competitors to replicate that.\u201d\n\nNvidia also benefits by selling full-on supercomputers for AI applications, which can go for hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Nvidia benefits from largely working only with GPUs. Unlike AMD, it doesn\u2019t sell both CPUs and GPUs, and unlike Intel, it isn\u2019t reentering the discrete GPU market. The company is set to launch its own CPU code named Grace to ensure it can provide its customers with its own CPU \u2014 but so far it\u2019s been able to focus all of its efforts on GPUs.\n\n\u201cNvidia has had that part of the market to itself. It has the resources to invest into the markets, both gaming and the data center, which has helped it build its business,\u201d Priestley said. \u201cIt has one product GPUs, basically.\u201d\n\nStill, Nvidia\u2019s rivals aren\u2019t sitting idly by. And while the company is the market leader for now, there\u2019s no guarantee it will stay that way forever. It needs to continue to innovate at a rapid clip if it wants to hold on to its position at the top.\n\nBy Daniel Howley, tech editor at Yahoo Finance.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, Flipboard, and LinkedIn"

REUTERS/Tyrone Siu Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nAug 24 (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Energy is nearing a deal to purchase a supercomputer made with chips from Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O) as a key lab waits for a larger supercomputer from Intel Corp (INTC.O) that has been delayed for months, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.\n\nThe Nvidia and AMD machine, to be called Polaris, will not be a replacement for the Intel-based Aurora machine slated for the Argonne National Lab near Chicago, which was poised to be the nation's fastest computer when announced in 2019.\n\nInstead, Polaris, which will come online this year, will be a test machine for Argonne to start readying its software for the Intel machine, the people familiar with the matter said.\n\nArgonne spokesperson Ben Schiltz did not immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did AMD spokesperson Aaron Grabein. Nvidia spokesperson Ken Brown declined to comment.\n\nIntel, AMD and Nvidia are battling for market share for chips used in data centers. The United States' array of supercomputers do scientific work for healthcare, climate and other researchers, as well as performing virtual testing of the country's nuclear weapons.\n\nKey technologies pioneered in the systems often filter down to commercial data centers in subsequent years, giving an advantage to chip companies which win the contract work.\n\nWhen Aurora was first announced, Intel and Argonne said the machine would be delivered in 2021, but Intel still has not delivered the key Ponte Vecchio and Sapphire Rapids chips. Intel said in June that the Sapphire Rapids chips would not be in production until 2022, and on Tuesday Intel spokesperson Will Moss said the company remained committed to delivering the computer in 2022.\n\nThe $500 million contract called for Intel and partners to deliver a computer with so-called exaflop performance, or the ability to perform 1 quintillion - or 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 - calculations per second. Now, the first exascale computer in the United States will likely be a different machine at a different lab - Oak Ridge National Lab in Tennessee - built by Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co (HPE.N) with chips from AMD expected to be delivered later this year.\n\nThe Polaris machine at Argonne will not be as powerful as the Intel machine, the sources said. Based on Nvidia's A100 chips and AMD's Rome and Milan chips, the Polaris computer will be able to make some exaflop calculations but mostly work at slower speeds.\n\nReporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; editing by Peter Henderson and Jonathan Oatis\n\n\u79c1\u305f\u3061\u306e\u884c\u52d5\u898f\u7bc4\uff1a\u30c8\u30e0\u30bd\u30f3\u30fb\u30ed\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u300c\u4fe1\u983c\u306e\u539f\u5247\u300d"

        "text": "NVIDIA Corporation NVDA stock gained 5.6% on Monday after the company predicted that its first-quarter fiscal 2021 revenues would exceed the previous guidance. The graphic chip maker also unveiled a new product \u2014a central processing unit (CPU) \u2014 specifically designed for data centers, also provided reason for investors to cheer.\n\nQ1 Sales to Exceed Expectations\n\nDuring its annual GPU Technology Conference (GTC) event, NVIDIA\u2019s CFO Colette Kress said that the company is on track to report first-quarter 2021 revenues above management\u2019s earlier expectations of $5.3 billion. The CFO stated that the company is witnessing broad-based strength with all of its segments driving upside to initial outlook.\n\nKress noted, \u201cOverall demand remains very strong and continues to exceed supply while our channel inventories remain quite lean. We expect demand to continue to exceed supply for much of this year. We believe we will have sufficient supply to support sequential growth beyond Q1.\u201d\n\nThe company is expecting another impressive year for its data-center business as industries are increasingly using artificial intelligence (AI) to improve their products and services.

Stellar growth in GeForce desktop and notebook GPUs is boosting demand for its graphic chips. Furthermore, better visualization and speed are needed for a thrilling gaming experience, which NVIDIA successfully provides through its portfolio of Pascal architecture-based GPUs.\n\nAdditionally, a surge in the Hyperscale demand is a tailwind for the company\u2019s data-center business. Further, solid uptake of AI-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions is a boon.\n\nStory continues\n\nCPU for Data Centers\n\nApart from updating the first-quarter revenue outlook, NVIDIA surprised investors by unveiling its first CPU, Grace, specifically designed for data centers. The company claims that it will deliver 10 times greater performance than the present day\u2019s fastest servers that run AI applications and high-performance computing workloads.\n\nThe new processors will help NVIDIA better compete with its chief rivals \u2014 Intel INTC and Advanced Micro Devices AMD \u2014 which dominate the data-center market with their x86-based processors.\n\nThe Grace CPU is based on technology from Arm Holdings, which is being acquired by NVIDIA. Markedly, last September, NVIDIA inked an agreement to acquire Arm from its existing owner, Softbank Group, in a cash-and-stock deal worth $40 billion.\n\nThe Arm Holdings acquisition is anticipated to aid NVIDIA in offering an end-to-end ecosystem of technology across the data center, IoT, autonomous vehicles and mobile domains.

And it\u2019s unclear how NVIDIA is looking to adapt to the problems exposed in that card with its latest release.\n\nBut the launch of the limiter also coincided with the rollout of NVIDIA\u2019s Crypto Mining Processor or CMP series, designed specifically with professional miners in mind.\n\nThe products on that line had many essential parts stripped from the traditional GPU like the display ports, to provide more room for airflow. Adjustments were also made to elements like frequency and peak core voltage, both of which were decreased in order to raise hash rates for the cards.\n\nBetter efficiency?\n\nThe company\u2019s division which supports crypto mining has already forecast sales measuring $150 million for Q1 \u2014 nearly three times bigger than the company\u2019s previous estimate.\n\nIf the latest leaks are confirmed, the GeForce 3080 Ti would be around 22% more efficient than the 3080 card, which had a hash rate of 97 Mh/s, making the upcoming GPU a potentially attractive option for miners.\n\nNVIDIA is also yet to announce whether it will be retrofitting its older cards with the rumored anti-mining limiter.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe official release date for the 3080 Ti card hasn\u2019t been announced, though reports suggest it could hit markets as early as May.\n\nThis follows multiple delays, as NVIDIA has also been rocked by a global chip shortage during the pandemic, which has driven up prices for both the components and the products they\u2019re housed in.\n\nThe company has already announced that its stocks would \u201cremain lean throughout Q1\u201d, with the RTX 30-series bearing the brunt of that shortage."

        "text": "NVIDIA has released a major update for its Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) technology. With version 2.3 of the software, the company says the AI algorithm makes smarter use of motion vectors to improve how objects look when they\u2019re moving. The update also helps to reduce ghosting, make particle effects look clearer and improve temporal stability. The latter has traditionally been one of the weakest aspects of the technology, so DLSS 2.3 represents a major improvement. As of today, 16 games feature support for DLSS 2.3. Highlights include Cyberpunk 2077, Deathloop and Doom Eternal.\n\nIf you don\u2019t own an RTX GPU but still want to take advantage of the performance boost you can get from upscaling a game, NVIDIA has updated its Image Scaling technology to improve both fidelity and performance. Accessible through the NVIDIA Control Panel, the tool uses spatial upscaling to do the job. That means the result isn\u2019t as clean as the temporal method DLSS uses, but the advantage is you don\u2019t need special hardware. To that end, NVIDIA is releasing an SDK that will allow any GPU, regardless of make, to take advantage of the technology. In that way, NVIDIA says game developers can offer the best of both worlds: DLSS for the best possible image quality and NVIDIA Image Scaling for cross-platform support."

        "title": "Is Nvidia the Best Blockchain Stock?",
        "publish_date": "11/25/2020",
        "text": "- By Nicholas Kitonyi\n\n\n\n\n\nBlockchain has emerged as one of the most disruptive forces in the technology sector. However, while several people still prefer to invest via the cryptocurrency market, there are better options for those inclined to stocks.\n\nGraphics processing unit manufacturer Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been the preference for those looking to invest in the massive adoption of blockchain technology. The company's stock has surged nearly 700% over the last three years amid an increase in demand for its GPUs.\n\n\n\n\n\nIs Nvidia the Best Blockchain Stock?\n\nThis growth can be significantly attributed to the rapid growth of the cryptocurrency market, which peaked toward the end of 2017 and again this year. Cryptocurrency mining companies use Nvidia's GPUs to mine bitcoins and other digital currencies. The company's graphics processing technology is tipped to experience exponential growth in the coming years as mining activity increases.\n\nPotential alternatives to Nvidia\n\nNvidia is not the only big tech company looking to invest in blockchain. Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM) have also invested heavily in blockchain. For those looking to invest in single stocks with some focus on blockchain, these three should be on the list of potential picks.\n\nAnother option would be to target asset managers that specialize in blockchain and cryptocurrency assets. In this case, Mike Novogratz's Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd. (TSX:GLXY), which was founded just two years ago, comes close. The financial services company specializes in blockchain and cryptocurrency assets. It has grown to a market value of more than 550 million Canadian dollars ($423.3 million). This illustrates the growing appetite for blockchain asset managers.\n\nThe market has attracted companies from across the globe, including several that are privately held. South Korea's Hashed is another example. The Seoul-based firm has managed to grow its blockchain assets under management from $0.6 million in 2016 to more than $90 million net of fees.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company has taken an expansive approach to the market by combining blockchain advisory services with asset management. This gives it access to a wider market that includes project research and development for early-stage blockchain companies.\n\nWhy Nvidia stands out\n\nAll these could be potential alternatives to Nvidia for those looking to build a portfolio of diversified blockchain investments. However, Nvidia offers its own kind of diversification in the sense that its business covers other markets, including gaming, artificial intelligence and autonomous vehicles.\n\nThe gaming industry, in particular, is expected to continue to evolve in the coming years, thereby boosting growth. Artificial intelligence and autonomous vehicles are still at very early stages of growth, which means there could be huge opportunities for the company.\n\nOne key advantage that Nvidia has over other technology stocks looking to benefit from blockchain technology is that it does not have to create something new. Before companies started to use its hardware to mine bitcoins, Nvidia was selling to gaming companies and other tech companies.\n\nMicrosoft's direct link to blockchain technology is based on its Azure cloud service. The platform is built on the Ethereum network. As more companies embrace blockchain, the more they are likely to choose Azure for security reasons. But Amazon is doing the same with its web services platform.\n\nIn fact, Amazon has gone a step further to create an infrastructure for startups to build blockchain projects. For this reason, it could be the closest rival to Nvidia. Its expansive portfolio of services also creates avenues to expand its investment in blockchain. But again, there are several competing platforms that startups can use to build a blockchain project.\n\nNvidia's GPUs, on the other hand, do not appear to have much of a challenge when it comes to mining cryptocurrencies. Advanced Micro Devices Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AMD) Radeon RX series is perhaps the likely candidate to rival Nvidia's GeForce RTX series in the near future.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, it looks like Nvidia's position in the blockchain market is stronger than any of its close rivals. The company's product has gained so much popularity in the cryptocurrency mining space that it barely needs to market it. It is a self-seller. This is not the case for other big technology companies looking to capitalize on the adoption of blockchain technology.\n\nDisclosure: No positions in the stocks mentioned.\n\nRead more here:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot a Premium Member of GuruFocus?

Sales from this division exceeded gaming revenue for the first time in the fiscal second quarter.\n\nThe global shift to working and studying from home has fired up sales of laptops and increased demand for cloud services that rely on server computers using Nvidia graphics processors.\n\nNvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said the Covid-19 lockdown has accelerated trends that were already in place and that the use of his company\u2019s technology will continue to increase.\n\n\u201cThis is not a momentary thing, it\u2019s clearly the future brought to the present,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cNvidia computing is past the tipping point and its getting adopted in so many industries.\u201d\n\nData center chip sales came in at $1.75 billion in the fiscal second quarter. That was up 167% from the same period in 2019. The most-recent results included the acquisition of Mellanox Technologies Ltd. Revenue from gaming was $1.65 billion in the quarter, up 26% from a year earlier.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company is in negotiations to acquire Arm Ltd., whose chip designs and technology underpin the smartphone industry. The talks are are exclusive and would result in the largest ever industry acquisition, Bloomberg has reported.Huang leads a company that\u2019s captured the attention of investors like few others in the last decade. Nvidia\u2019s stock ended 2010 at $15.42 and closed at $485.54 in New York on Wednesday. That\u2019s given it a market value of about $300 billion, almost $100 billion more than Intel Corp., the world\u2019s largest chipmaker.\n\nHuang didn\u2019t comment on Arm, other than to praise its technological capabilities and say he loves working and competing with the company.\n\nGross margin, or the percentage of sales remaining after deducting the cost of production, will be about 62.5% in the current quarter, Nvidia also said.\n\nProfit in the fiscal second quarter was $622 million, or 99 cents a share, compared with $552 million, or 90 cents, a year earlier. Revenue surged 50% to $3.87 billion and profit excluding certain costs was $2.18 a share in the period, which ended July 26, the company said. Analysts, on average, had predicted earnings of $1.97 a share on sales of $3.66 billion.\n\n(Updates with executive comments in second paragraph)\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\nSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\n\n\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P."

Looking back over the last year, the stock has been a solid performer, with a gain of 12%.\n\nAssuming nothing else has changed, a lower share price makes a stock more attractive to potential buyers. While the market sentiment towards a stock is very changeable, in the long run, the share price will tend to move in the same direction as earnings per share. So, on certain occasions, long term focussed investors try to take advantage of pessimistic expectations to buy shares at a better price. Perhaps the simplest way to get a read on investors' expectations of a business is to look at its Price to Earnings Ratio (PE Ratio). Investors have optimistic expectations of companies with higher P/E ratios, compared to companies with lower P/E ratios.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for NVIDIA\n\nDoes NVIDIA Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?\nWe can tell from its P/E ratio of 42.78 that there is some investor optimism about NVIDIA. You can see in the image below that the average P/E (22.9) for companies in the semiconductor industry is lower than NVIDIA's P/E.\n\nNVIDIA's P/E tells us that market participants think the company will perform better than its industry peers, going forward. Shareholders are clearly optimistic, but the future is always uncertain. So investors should always consider the P/E ratio alongside other factors, such as whether company directors have been buying shares.\n\nHow Growth Rates Impact P/E Ratios\nGenerally speaking the rate of earnings growth has a profound impact on a company's P/E multiple. When earnings grow, the 'E' increases, over time. That means even if the current P/E is high, it will reduce over time if the share price stays flat. Then, a lower P/E should attract more buyers, pushing the share price up.\n\nNVIDIA saw earnings per share decrease by 33% last year. But it has grown its earnings per share by 32% per year over the last five years.\n\nA Limitation: P/E Ratios Ignore Debt and Cash In The Bank\nOne drawback of using a P/E ratio is that it considers market capitalization, but not the balance sheet. Thus, the metric does not reflect cash or debt held by the company. The exact same company would hypothetically deserve a higher P/E ratio if it had a strong balance sheet, than if it had a weak one with lots of debt, because a cashed up company can spend on growth.\n\nWhile growth expenditure doesn't always pay off, the point is that it is a good option to have; but one that the P/E ratio ignores.\n\nSo What Does NVIDIA's Balance Sheet Tell Us?\nNVIDIA has net cash of US$8.9b. That should lead to a higher P/E than if it did have debt, because its strong balance sheets gives it more options.\n\nThe Bottom Line On NVIDIA's P/E Ratio\nNVIDIA's P/E is 42.8 which is way above average (12.7) in its market. Falling earnings per share is probably keeping traditional value investors away, but the net cash position means the company has time to improve: and the high P/E suggests the market thinks it will. Given NVIDIA's P/E ratio has declined from 63.1 to 42.8 in the last month, we know for sure that the market is significantly less confident about the business today, than it was back then. For those who prefer to invest with the flow of momentum, that might be a bad sign, but for a contrarian, it may signal opportunity.\n\nInvestors have an opportunity when market expectations about a stock are wrong. People often underestimate remarkable growth -- so investors can make money when fast growth is not fully appreciated. So this free visualization of the analyst consensus on future earnings could help you make the right decision about whether to buy, sell, or hold.\n\nBut note: NVIDIA may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with strong recent earnings growth (and a P/E ratio below 20).\n\nIf you spot an error that warrants correction, please contact the editor at editorial-team@simplywallst.com.

        "title":"Nvidia Poised for Record Sales as AI Demand Kicks In",
        "publish_date": "05/25/2023",
        "text": "Chip giant Nvidia NVDA 1.06%increase; green up pointing triangle is starting to capitalize on the craze for language-generating artificial intelligence, projecting a more than 64% jump in sales as the company rushes to get more processors in customer hands to satisfy booming interest in the technology.\n\nA new generation of advanced Nvidia chips for AI calculations in data centers is in production, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said, and “we are significantly increasing our supply to meet surging demand for them.”\n\nNvidia’s shares, which have more than doubled in value this year, surged over 25% in premarket trading. The rise puts Nvidia, the U.S.’s largest chip-supplier by market value, on course for a record close and for a market cap comfortably above $900 billion.\n\nThe company forecast a record $11 billion in sales for the current quarter, far above the $7.2 billion Wall Street was expecting and what would be the highest quarterly total ever for the company.\n\n“This demand has extended our data center visibility out a few quarters and we have procured substantially higher supply for the second-half of the year,” Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said on an earnings call.\n\nDemand for computing power that drives language-generating tools such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT is opening a huge new revenue opportunity for the company and others. It has spurred an arms race between tech giants to offer advanced AI features to their customers. Microsoft, which has invested in OpenAI, has been adding the technology to its Bing search engine and business software products. Google has introduced its own advanced AI tools. Facebook parent Meta Platforms also has been working on the technology. Nvidia’s chips are essential in creating these kinds of tools, analysts say, and building just one such AI system can require thousands of Nvidia’s computing engines.\n\nHuang said the company was well-prepared to benefit from the AI opportunity because it was starting to produce a new wave of advanced equipment for data centers when the explosion of interest began last year. “I call it the iPhone moment,” he said, referring to the shift toward smartphones that Apple capitalized on by releasing its advanced handset about 16 years ago. “All the technology came together and helped everybody realize what an amazing product that can be and what capabilities it can have.”\n\nNvidia doesn’t manufacture its own chips, but farms out production to contract chip-makers including the world’s largest, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. TSMC’s American depositary receipts rose by 6% premarket in the wake of Nvidia’s results.\n\nNvidia may be the leading provider of AI chips, but Huang said the battle to supply chips to satisfy demand is fierce. “We have competition from every direction,” he said, from established semiconductor companies to startups.\n\nNvidia on Wednesday said revenue fell 13% to $7.2 billion in its last fiscal quarter, topping forecasts from analysts surveyed by FactSet. Net profit rose 26% to $2 billion. The sales retreat was driven by a sharp decline in the graphics chips business for videogamers, who pulled back after the pandemic eased and are only beginning to resume buying.\n\nHuang said operators of big data centers are retooling their computing infrastructure to better address the opportunities offered by AI, creating surging demand for its chips.\n\n“A trillion dollars of installed global data center infrastructure will transition from general purpose to accelerated computing as companies race to apply generative AI into every product, service and business process,” he said.\n\nNvidia’s data center revenue rose to $4.28 billion in its latest quarter, a record, which Kress said reflected strong demand from consumer internet companies and cloud-computing companies.\n\nNvidia has said it is working on generative AI with Amazon.com, Microsoft and Alphabet’s Google unit, and is partnering with cloud-computing companies to help make generative AI available to smaller businesses. The company on Tuesday said it was adding its AI software to Microsoft’s Azure cloud-computing service, allowing corporate customers to tap in to its chips and software to speed up large generative AI systems.\n\nNvidia has its roots in graphics-processing chips for videogamers, but has diversified its customer base rapidly in recent years. Engineers found the chips to be well-suited to AI tasks and cryptocurrency mining, which led to an explosion of new sources of demand.\n\nThe company has tried to capitalize on that shift by making specialized chips for those markets. Its AI chips have helped its data center division surpass its gaming division in revenues over the past few quarters, a major break from the past. The company has recently begun to roll out a new generation of AI chips for data centers that promise a substantial performance upgrade, and many customers have had to wait for them amid red-hot demand.\n\nThe company’s gaming division fell by 38% to $2.2 billion in the latest quarter, which Kress attributed to the macroeconomic slowdown and Nvidia limiting shipments so customers run through existing inventories of chips.\n\nAmid the growth in AI-related sales, new U.S. regulations seeking to hamstring China’s AI industry limited the sale of Nvidia chips there. Nvidia has developed versions of its chips that don’t exceed performance thresholds, but the company said last year that the curbs could cost it up to $400 million in quarterly sales."

NVDA 1.01%increase; green up pointing triangle into the top 10 U.S. public companies, joining the likes of Apple Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nShares of the Santa Clara, Calif., firm have risen nearly 80% over the past year, giving it a market value of around $453 billion. That is more than rivals Intel Corp. and Broadcom Inc. combined.\n\nNvidia makes processors that power gaming and cryptocurrency mining. Chip shares have risen in part thanks to a pandemic-induced global shortage of semiconductors that has driven up the prices of everything from laptops to automobiles.\n\nOne reason for Nvidia’s outperformance, analysts say, is that its chips’ parallel-computing capabilities make them better than rivals’ for artificial-intelligence performance and mining cryptocurrencies. Nvidia’s graphics processors are used for mining ethereum and the cryptocurrency’s value has soared this year, even after a recent correction.\n\nThat surge has exacerbated the shortage of gaming chips. Nvidia plans to sell cards aimed at the crypto market and has employed technical adjustments to make gaming processors less useful to miners. Analysts also expect Nvidia to get a boost from tech and autonomous-vehicle companies using its chips to navigate traffic or track online behavior.\n\n“The company is the biggest and best supplier of parallel computing,” said Ambrish Srivastava, analyst at BMO Capital Markets. “It’s hard to compete against that.”\n\nWhile Nvidia has a leg up in the data-center industry, competitors are catching up, analysts said. The recent slide in crypto also could spur miners to dump their chips on the secondary market, as happened when a previous ethereum skid hit revenue in 2018."

        "text": "Graphics-chip company Nvidia Corp. NVDA 1.07%increase; green up pointing triangle posted another quarter of record sales amid supercharged demand for videogaming and data centers.\n\nAmerica’s largest chip company by market value has enjoyed a period of strong growth with the pandemic boosting consumer appetite for videogames and the wider adoption of digital services that run on data centers.\n\nNvidia said Wednesday that sales for the third quarter rose 50% to $7.1 billion, generating net income of $2.46 billion. The figures surpassed Wall Street expectations, with analysts surveyed by FactSet estimating the company would bring in $6.8 billion in revenue and $2.27 billion in net income. Revenue was buoyed by record videogaming sales of $3.2 billion, up 42% from the year-ago period, and record data-center sales, up 55% from the same time a year earlier.\n\nShares in the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company fell 3.1% to $292.61. They rose more than 3% in aftermarket trading following the results.\n\nThe strong results come in the face of a global semiconductor shortage that has dented sales of a diverse range of products, including gaming consoles and cars. Wait times for some types of processors are reaching record lengths and buyers are hoarding products. Intel Corp. Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger has said he thinks the shortage could last into 2023.\n\nNvidia said it has taken extra steps to assure long-term supply agreements and, as part of that effort, made $1.64 billion in advance payments in the third quarter. “We feel very good about our supply situation, particularly starting in the second half of next year and going forward,” Chief Executive Jensen Huang said on an analysts call.\n\nNvidia Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress on Wednesday said supply-chain constraints hitting car makers led Nvidia automotive sales to fall 11% from the second quarter, though they were still up 8% from the year-ago period as customers ramped up self-driving-vehicle programs, she said.\n\nMr. Huang also has been pushing the company into new markets, with increasing business providing chips for cars at a time vehicles use more processors. The company this year also said it would offer central processing units for data centers in a challenge to Intel.\n\nNvidia last year agreed to buy chip-design specialist Arm Holdings for around $40 billion in a deal that would further expand its reach. The deal still awaits regulatory approval and has drawn opposition from customers of U.K.-based Arm. The British government this week extended a probe into the deal, citing what it said were “significant competition concerns.”\n\nThe U.S. Federal Trade Commission also has expressed concern about the deal. Ms. Kress said the company is “engaged in discussions with the FTC regarding remedies to address those concerns.”\n\nNvidia has defended its planned purchase and said it wouldn’t stifle competition. “We continue to believe in the merits and benefits of the acquisition,” Ms. Kress said.\n\nChina also has begun to review the transaction, Nvidia said.\n\nMr. Huang now has his sights set on the so-called metaverse, a loosely defined group of online realms where users playing as avatars can hang out and participate in immersive experiences with others. Nvidia is offering software called Omniverse Enterprise that offers collaboration and simulation tools such as the ability to create interactive artificial-intelligence avatars. The company has billed the set of tools as foundational to creating and connecting virtual worlds and customers can gain access to them on a subscription basis. Mr. Huang has said he thinks the metaverse economy has the potential to be bigger than the current one.\n\nThe metaverse, Mr. Huang said, will generate hardware and software sales, some in the near term. Digital avatars could come with a $1,000 a year subscription, he said, and growth in the metaverse will spur demand for Nvidia chips. Revenue likely will split with half generated by hardware sales and half by software licenses, he said.\n\n“This is really going to be one of the largest graphics opportunities that we’ve ever seen,” he said.\n\nNvidia on Wednesday said it expects $7.4 billion in sales for the current quarter, beating forecasts, with datacenters growing faster than gaming. Mr. Huang said datacenter customers concerned about chip shortages have made commitments that give Nvidia good visibility on that business."

NVDA 1.07%increase; green up pointing triangle continued its run of strong financial performance during the coronavirus pandemic, posting record sales in the latest quarter propelled by strong demand for online gaming and remote computing services.\n\nThe Santa Clara, Calif.-based company said earnings per share for the quarter ended July 31 rose to 99 cents from 90 cents in the year-ago period driven by a 50% jump in sales to $3.87 billion. Wall Street expected earnings of 95 cents a share and $3.65 billion in revenue.\n\n“The pandemic will have a lasting impact on how we work,” financial chief Colette Kress told analysts on a call, adding that the company’s sales mix would “likely reflect this evolution in enterprise workforce trends with a greater focus on technologies, such as Nvidia laptops and virtual workstations, that enable remote work and virtual collaboration.”\n\nNvidia shares have surged during the health crisis, making it the best performing stock in the S&P 500 index and overtaking Intel Corp. INTC -0.19%decrease; red down pointing triangle as the largest U.S. semiconductor company by value. While Intel has stumbled with development of its newest chips, punishing the stock, Nvidia has enjoyed investor favor because its chips—optimized to run the intense calculations for graphics—are in hot demand as people turn to videogames for distraction while stuck at home. The company is now valued at around $300 billion after its stock more than doubled this year, almost $100 billion more than Intel. Intel, in turn, has seen its stock fall almost 20% in 2020.\n\nIntel on Wednesday said it plans to buy back $10 billion of its stock on an accelerated basis, as part of a $20 billion repurchase program it suspended in March. “Intel shares are currently trading well below our intrinsic valuation,” Chief Executive Bob Swann said, adding that data-driven chip demand gives him confidence in the company’s product plan.\n\nNvidia shares, which hit a record level this week, closed down 1% Wednesday and slid 1.7% in after-hours trading. Intel’s stock rose 3.9% after hours following its share repurchase disclosure.\n\nNvidia also has benefited from higher demand for cloud-computing infrastructure as more companies have shifted to working remotely, helping deliver growth for vendors such as Amazon.com Inc.

Nvidia in May said it shipped the first DGX A100—a new line of high-performance computers—to the U.S. Department of Energy’s Argonne National Laboratory for Covid-19 research.\n\nThe company said last quarter’s data-center business, which includes DGX sales and revenue from recently acquired Mellanox Technologies, more than doubled to a record $1.75 billion. Revenue at its games segment increased 26% to $1.65 billion.\n\nNvidia, for the current quarter, projects record revenue of about $4.4 billion. Wall Street is expecting $3.97 billion, according to analysts surveyed by FactSet. Gaming and data-center sales are projected to drive the increase, Ms. Kress said.\n\nThe recent strength for the data-center and gaming businesses aren’t just a temporary, pandemic-effect, Chief Executive Jensen Huang said in the call. “This is the future,” he said, “and there’s no going back.”\n\nThe company, though, wasn’t immune to effects of the pandemic on the wider economy. Sales for its professional visualization segment fell 30% from a year ago because corporate customers delayed workstation spending, Nvidia said. Sales to the hard-hit car sector, down 47% year-over-year, also weighed on revenue. Company officials said auto production volumes have started to recover but remain well below prepandemic levels.\n\n“Despite the pandemic’s impact on our professional visualization and automotive platforms, we are well positioned to grow, as gaming, AI, cloud computing and autonomous machines drive the next industrial revolution around the world,” Mr. Huang said."

        "title":"How Nvidia’s CEO Cooked Up America’s Biggest Semiconductor Company",
        "publish_date": "09/15/2020",
        "text": "In the midst of the pandemic, Nvidia Corp. Chief Executive Jensen Huang engineered his company’s biggest game changer from his kitchen: a $40 billion acquisition that could cement his status as the semiconductor industry’s hottest CEO.\n\nThe proposed acquisition of Arm Holdings from SoftBank Group Corp., 9984 0.13%increase; green up pointing triangle in the chip industry’s biggest deal ever, would transform Nvidia into a force across the most important arenas of computing, from servers and PCs to consumer electronics to smartphones, making it one of the most formidable threatsIntel Corp. has ever faced. To do so, though, Mr. Huang still needs to clear regulatory hurdles and potential opposition from competitors that may appeal to authorities to block the deal.\n\nThe deal is a milestone in an extraordinary run over the past few years, one that has transformed Nvidia from a niche maker of high-end graphics chips for gamers into the most valuable U.S. chip company. “I couldn’t have dreamed two years ago that I’d be sitting here,” Mr. Huang told The Wall Street Journal this week.\n\nNvidia’s market value has soared to $319.8 billion, surpassing Intel’s valuation of $214.5 billion, even though Nvidia had $10.92 billion in annual sales in its latest fiscal year, compared with $71.97 billion for Intel. Nvidia’s bet on some of the hottest fields in tech, videogaming and artificial intelligence, have fueled investor enthusiasm, while Intel has stumbled with some of its most advanced chips.\n\nIt is a long way from 1993, when Mr. Huang dreamed up Nvidia on his 30th birthday at a Denny’s in San Jose, Calif., with two like-minded engineers. They bet on a future where consumers demanded better computer graphics, which would require specialized, high-performance hardware that wasn’t available at the time.\n\nThat bet has paid off. Videogaming has taken off, and its processors have found new applications. To deliver the best video content, Nvidia’s graphics chips handle data differently than traditional designs, processing information in parallel rather than sequentially. That approach has also proven particularly useful to cryptocurrency mining and running AI software that is in increasingly hot demand.\n\nMr. Huang, now 57 years old, early on styled himself after Steve Jobs, adopting a black leather jacket as his edgier version of the late Apple Inc. AAPL 0.13%increase; green up pointing triangle co-founder’s black turtleneck. Also like Mr. Jobs, the Nvidia boss hogs the stage during his company’s unveilings of ever-faster graphics chips.\n\nThe Arm deal couldn’t have happened if it weren’t for Mr. Huang’s ties to SoftBank’s CEO, Masayoshi Son, who bought Cambridge, England-based Arm in 2016 for $32 billion. SoftBank has invested in Nvidia and, at the end of June, held a stake valued at around $245 million at Monday’s close.\n\nSoftBank first approached Nvidia earlier this year to gauge Mr. Huang’s interest in making a deal. “At some point it became clear that SoftBank would be interested in maybe not holding onto Arm, and I just jumped on the opportunity,” Mr. Huang said, adding his focus then turned to ensuring Nvidia was the top bidder.\n\nMr. Huang limited his use of outside bankers and largely negotiated the deal with an internal team. Amid the pandemic, he worked out the terms not from the company’s Santa Clara, Calif., headquarters, but from his nearby home in the hills outside Palo Alto, where he also hosted virtual conferences and product launches from his kitchen, occasionally shedding his signature leather jacket for a down vest.\n\nTo James Wang, a former Nvidia product manager who is now an analyst at New York-based asset manager Ark Invest, which is an investor in Nvidia through some of its funds, the Arm deal is a sign that Mr. Huang realized that the next step of Nvidia’s growth couldn’t happen without outside help. “That’s the attitude change that’s enabled Nvidia to go from a big M&A-averse company to one that’s just swinging for the fences,” he said.\n\nArm, known for its power-efficient chip design, could become a potent tool for Mr. Huang to battle Intel across a broader range of products. Apple said in June that it was ditching Intel in its Mac computers in favor of its own chip design with Arm ingredients.\n\nMr. Huang says Nvidia could offer Arm an entry into hardware for AI computations in devices like phones, watches, gadgets and cars—areas where it previously had a more limited presence. At the same time, Nvidia could help introduce Arm-based devices into central processors for the kind of servers that go into big data centers and supercomputers and challenge Intel’s dominance there.\n\nEric Ross, chief strategist at Cascend Securities in New York, said Mr. Huang told him about two decades ago that he was gunning for Intel, betting that his graphics processors would become the calculation workhorses of the next age of computing. “It did take awhile, but he’s had his eye on this for a very long time,” Mr. Ross said.\n\nNvidia has faced recent setbacks. Its growth slumped after the boom in cryptocurrencies flamed out. An earlier foray into smartphone modems via an acquisition in 2011 fizzled, and the company wound down the business in 2015.\n\nAnd the sale of some of its chips and their use in China for artificial intelligence has raised concerns in Washington.\n\nThe Arm deal also could run into political turbulence amid the U.S. battle with China over dominance in the tech sector. Huawei Technologies Co., which has been at the center of U.S. efforts to curb China’s technology ambitions, is a big Arm customer and would owe Nvidia licensing fees to use its technology.\n\nNvidia’s biggest acquisition to date, a $7 billion deal for Mellanox Technologies Ltd., faced delays because of protracted regulatory scrutiny in China. It closed in April.\n\nBritish politicians have already expressed reservations over potential job losses at Arm’s home base. Arm has around 6,700 employees. Nvidia and Arm have promised to establish a new AI research center with a new supercomputer in Cambridge that would be open to researchers in the U.K. and elsewhere.\n\nChip-industry opposition will also likely be strong, analysts say. Some of Arm’s customers also compete with Nvidia, raising questions about Arm’s neutrality should the deal go through. Arm has long acted as a kind of Switzerland to the chip industry, offering its designs to everyone without favoring any one company.
