On Wednesday, it eclipsed VW's $99.4 billion value.\n\nToyota still holds pole position with a market cap of $233 billion.\n\nThe recent gains have been fueled by a surprise third-quarter profit, progress at a new factory in China and better-than-expected car deliveries in the fourth quarter.\n\nMany investors remain skeptical that Tesla can consistently deliver profit, cash flow and growth.\n\nBut the gains highlight growing confidence among investors about the future of electric vehicles and Tesla\u2019s shift from a niche car maker into a global leader in cleaner cars.\n\nA glance at its results shows it has a long way to go before it can eclipse larger rivals.\n\nBased on 12-month forward sales estimates, it doesn\u2019t even appear in the top 20 in the world.

        "text": "(Reuters) - Tesla Inc said on Thursday it will suspend production at its San Francisco Bay Area vehicle factory on March 24, ending a standoff with California authorities concerned about the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nThe company said its New York solar roof tile factory also will temporarily suspend production, while operations at its Nevada battery plant will continue.\n\n\u201cDespite taking all known health precautions, continued operations in certain locations has caused challenges for our employees, their families and our suppliers,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nTesla\u2019s shares were down 8% in after-hours trading following the announcement.\n\nThe decision to suspend production at the Fremont, California, plant comes as Tesla ramps up production of its Model Y sport utility vehicle at the factory. Demand for the Model Y is expected to be higher than for all of Tesla\u2019s other models combined, Chief Executive Elon Musk has said.\n\nMusk on Thursday tweeted that Tesla\u2019s China operations were running \u201cnormally across hundreds of suppliers & all of Tesla Shanghai.\u201d The $2 billion Shanghai factory, which started delivering Model 3 sedans in December, is key to Tesla\u2019s growth strategy and the company plans to expand production capacity there.\n\nA Shanghai-based Tesla representative told Reuters the Chinese factory\u2019s production rate has exceeded pre-coronavirus levels and over 91% of workers have returned to work since March 6.\n\nTesla plans to start building Model Y SUVs in Shanghai from 2021 and expand car parts manufacturing capacity, a government document seen by Reuters showed.\n\nCui Dongshu, secretary general at the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) told Reuters Tesla sold around 3,900 vehicles in February, up from 2,620 vehicles in January.\n\nSlideshow ( 4 images )\n\nTesla\u2019s decision to suspend production at its San Francisco area plant came after several days of discussions with local officials and after the company met on Thursday with the city of Fremont.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s governor on Thursday issued a statewide \u201cstay at home\u201d order to residents, telling them to leave their homes only when necessary during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe highly contagious respiratory illness has infected more than 10,700 in the United States.\n\nThe automaker also said it believed it had enough liquidity to successfully navigate the extended period of uncertainty, with some $6.3 billion in cash at the end of the third quarter, ahead of a recent $2.3 billion capital raise.\n\nThe city and officials from the surrounding Alameda County did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday.\n\nAlameda County is one of six counties covered by an order from regional officials to \u201cshelter in place,\u201d which limits activity, travel and business functions to only the most essential, and advises people to stay home except for the most crucial reasons.\n\nThe county sheriff\u2019s office said on Tuesday afternoon Tesla was not considered an essential business and cannot continue to operate its factory normally.\n\nTesla said on Thursday it would continue basic operations at the Fremont factory in compliance with the order to support vehicle and energy services and charging infrastructure.\n\nSlideshow ( 4 images )\n\nTesla\u2019s sole U.S. auto factory employs more than 10,000 workers, with annualized production of slightly more than 415,000 units by the end of December 2019.\n\nIn an email to employees on Thursday, Tesla said operations at the Fremont plant will transition to \u201cminimum basic operations\u201d beginning on March 24.\n\nEmployees at the California and New York factories will be provided with paid leave during suspended operations, the email said.\n\nTesla\u2019s Giga factory in Nevada, which employs around 7,000 people, produces battery packs for its electric vehicles and stationary storage systems.\n\nIts Buffalo, New York, plant produces the company\u2019s solar roof tiles as well as some Supercharger and energy storage components. It has more than 1,500 workers in Buffalo, the company said last month.\n\nU.S. automakers Ford Motor Co, General Motors Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, on Wednesday said they were shuttering their U.S. plants, as well as factories in Canada and Mexico, to stop the spread of coronavirus."

        "text": "NEW YORK/BEIJING (Reuters) - Tesla Inc TSLA.O cannot continue to operate its main U.S. vehicle plant normally as its San Francisco Bay Area home began a three-week lockdown on Tuesday to slow the spread of coronavirus, a county sheriff's office spokesman said.\n\nThe comment relates to Tesla\u2019s factory in Fremont, Alameda County, which employs more than 10,000 workers and recorded annualized production of about 415,000 electric vehicles as at the end of December.\n\nThe order comes as Tesla ramps up production of its Model Y sport-utility vehicle at the factory. Billionaire Chief Executive Elon Musk has said the model will see higher demand than all of Tesla\u2019s other models combined.\n\nAlameda is one of at least nine counties covered by a \u2018shelter in place\u2019 order that limits activity, travel and business functions to only the most essential, and advises people to stay home except for the most crucial reasons.\n\nIt is aimed at helping stem a pandemic which has affected nearly 200,000 people worldwide and killed more than 100 in the United States including 12 in California.\n\nThe order will be an additional headache for Tesla, which was forced to shut down its $2 billion Shanghai factory for 10 days on top of the traditional week-long Lunar New Year holiday this year due to the rapidly spreading coronavirus.\n\n\u201cTesla is not an essential business as defined in the Alameda County Health Order. Tesla can maintain minimum basic operations per the Alameda County Health Order,\u201d the spokesman said.\n\nSlideshow ( 2 images )\n\nUnder the order announced Monday afternoon, businesses deemed non-essential can only maintain minimum basic operations, such as maintaining the value of inventory, ensuring security and processing payroll and employee benefits. Violations or failure to comply is punishable by fine, imprisonment, or both.\n\nThe spokesman said his office had not spoken to Tesla since implementing the order, which takes effect from Tuesday.\n\nTesla did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. Its share price fell 5.1% in after-hours trade on Tuesday.\n\nThe order is the latest to hit the global auto industry, which has taken a major hit from the outbreak.\n\nThe Big Three Detroit automakers - General Motors Co GM.N, Ford Motor Co F.N and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV FCHA.MI - and the United Auto Workers union agreed Tuesday to curtail production at U.S. factories and limit the number of workers on the job at one time.\n\nPrior to the county\u2019s order, Tesla had told employees in an email that the automaker and its suppliers would continue operations supporting manufacturing and vehicle delivery, a person who had seen the email told Reuters.\n\nIn another memo on Monday, Musk told employees he was not aware of any workers who had tested positive for the virus, and urged them to stay home if they felt the \u201cslightest bit ill or even uncomfortable\u201d, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s Department of Public Health in a statement said it would issue shutdown guidelines for manufacturing facilities in the days ahead.\n\nBay Area counties had reported 273 coronavirus infections by Monday. California has reported 12 deaths from the COVID-19 respiratory illness caused by the virus."

        "publish_date": "09/01/2020",
        "text": "Tuesday, September 1, 2020\n\nGet the Morning Brief sent directly to your inbox every Monday to Friday by 6:30 a.m. ET.\n\nSubscribe\n\nThere are now more shares of Apple and Tesla to go around\n\nOn Monday, shares of Apple (AAPL) and Tesla (TSLA) began trading on a split-adjusted basis.\n\nApple shares split 4-for-1 and Tesla split 5-for-1.\n\nSo for each share of Apple someone owned on Friday, as of Monday they owned four. For Tesla, that number is now five.\n\nInvestors were excited about this news \u2014 on Monday, shares of Apple rose 3.3% while Tesla shares gained a whopping 12.5%. Both stocks closed at record highs.\n\nWhich both makes sense and doesn\u2019t.\n\nOn the one hand, both companies said these stock splits were designed to create broader access to their shares.\n\nAs part of its July 30 earnings release, Apple said, \u201cThe Board of Directors has also approved a four-for-one stock split to make the stock more accessible to a broader base of investors.\u201d On August 11, Tesla said in a press release, \u201c[Tesla\u2019s] Board of Directors has approved and declared a five-for-one split of Tesla\u2019s common stock in the form of a stock dividend to make stock ownership more accessible to employees and investors.\u201d (Emphasis added.)\n\nAnd the rally in both stocks on Monday shows that wider access did indeed create incremental demand for shares.\n\nBut with Robinhood and other online brokerages offering investors access to fractional ownership in shares, it is somewhat surprising that so many investors were still enticed by any newfound affordability of a full share of either company. Especially since the split-adjusted price of a single share of Tesla \u2014 now $498.32 as of Monday\u2019s close \u2014 is basically the same as the price Apple deemed too high.\n\nStock splits are also just cosmetic changes in the number of outstanding shares a company has issued and the price of said shares. Splitting a stock does not change the value of a business.\n\nThe textbook would thus tell you to expect no change in the price of a company\u2019s stock because the stock was split. Cutting a pizza into 16 pieces instead of 8 does not create more pizza. It just creates more slices of the same pizza.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd as JonesTrading\u2019s Dave Lutz flagged on Monday, after each of Apple\u2019s four previous stock splits the stock fell over the next 10 trading days. If anything, then, history suggests Monday\u2019s split would be negative for Apple stock.\n\nHowever, the idea of a liquidity premium says that both stocks should trade higher if it is easier to trade shares with this new, lower price. In other words, because it is harder to transact in a stock that is $1,000 versus one that is $100, the $100 stock should trade at a slight premium because it is a more liquid asset.\n\nAnd Monday\u2019s price action does show shares of both Apple and Tesla had experienced an illiquidity discount before these splits.\n\nAnd perhaps reveals this episode as yet another example of the 2020 stock market in which things can seem both crazy and yet make total sense at the same time.\n\nBy Myles Udland, reporter and co-anchor of The Final Round.

        "text": "Tesla (TSLA) shares closed 12% higher today on its first day of trading post its stock split. The stock closed at $498.32.\n\nThe 5-for-1 split \u2014 the first in the company\u2019s history\u2014was announced earlier in August when the share price was below $1,400. The stock has gone up since then, closing at $2,213.40 last Friday (that\u2019s $442.68 on a split-adjusted basis).\n\nOver the summer Tesla eclipsed Toyota (TM) to become the largest auto company in the world. Its market cap now sits at around $412 billion.\n\nThe stock has been on fire this year, up about 495% year-to-date, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq (^IXIC) have rallied 8.34% and 31.14% respectively.\n\nAnalysts have been racing to re-rate the stock, with one analyst calling Tesla\u2019s valuation \u201cmind-boggling\u201d.\n\nThe stock\u2019s price target was recently raised at Jeffries to a street high of $2,500, in part because of the company\u2019s upcoming Battery Day on September 22. Wall Street and competitors will be watching to see if a million-mile battery is unveiled that day.\n\nWedbush\u2019s Dan Ives recently laid out a bull case scenario of $3,500, though his current price target is $1,900. Adjusting for the stock split, Ives\u2019 new price target is $380 with a bull case of $700. He has told Yahoo Finance Tesla \u201cis a tech company, not an automobile company.\u201d\n\nTesla\u2019s latest 2nd quarter results announced in July beat expectations.

REUTERS/Aly Song\n\nThe adjusted stock split occurred on the same day Apple (AAPL) also split its shares 4-to-1. The move increases the size of the float, but does not change the valuation of the company. More shares at a lower price is as a way to make them more accessible to individual investors.\n\nIn May, when the stock was around $780, Elon Musk tweeted \u201cTesla stock price is too high imo,\" sending shares tumbling 9%.\n\nInvestors have been pouring money into the expanding electric vehicles space. Tesla\u2019s competitor NIO (NIO) has seen gains of about 380% year-to-date on the heels of deliveries which smashed expectations, and better than expected quarterly results.\n\nStory continues\n\nXPeng (XPEV), another Chinese electric vehicle maker went public last week, raising $1.5 billion.

        "publish_date": "09/04/2020",
        "text": "Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares are up another 7.7% this week after completing its stock split and announcing a $5 billion at-the-market offering. Tesla stock short sellers are understandably frustrated that it continues to skyrocket despite no major news from the company about its actual business.\n\ntsla stock\n\nSource: Ivan Marc / Shutterstock.com\n\nI\u2019ve repeatedly discussed how overvalued Tesla is compared to both auto stock and tech stock peers. But I\u2019ve also been adamant that traders shouldn\u2019t touch Tesla on the long or short side.\n\nEven the most convicted Tesla bulls and bears must admit there is something screwy going on with the stock. Yes, there are theories about strange option trading or short squeezes or even organized crime. But I believe there is a better explanation for the Tesla bubble based on market psychology.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe Religion of Tesla Stock\n\nOne of the first things that stood out to me about Tesla starting late last year was just how much animosity there was between Tesla bulls and bears. I wrote several months ago about the reason why people love and hate Tesla stock so much is because a lot of people have made it a proxy for their political ideology. But I think one of the reasons why investors seem willing to buy Tesla shares at literally any price is because their association with Tesla is something more meaningful than simple politics.\n\nFor better or worse, the US has gotten less religious in recent decades. That trend away from religion has been particularly strong among younger Americans.\n\nAndrew Sullivan is one of many writers who have theorized that as the U.S. has become less religious, politics has taken over to fill our psychological need to find meaning in the world.\n\n\u201cThe need for meaning hasn\u2019t gone away, but without Christianity, this yearning looks to politics for satisfaction\u2026 And like almost all new cultish impulses, they demand a total and immediate commitment to save the world,\u201d Sullivan wrote in 2018.\n\nStory continues\n\nI think part of the reason Tesla stock investors keep buying the stock no matter how high the stock price goes is because supporting the company and what it stands for makes them feel the same sense of meaning that religion does.\n\nWhen TSLA investors buy the stock, it may not necessarily be only about making money. I think some of them just like to feel like they are a part of something that brings meaning to their lives.\n\nReligion vs. Cult\n\nIn the past, I have referred to Tesla stock as a \u201ccult\u201d stock. I\u2019m now making a distinction between \u201ccult\u201d and \u201creligion\u201d for two reasons. First, there is such a thing as a cult stock. A company like Fannie Mae (OTC:FNMA) is a cult stock because its investors value it more on what it could be than what it actually is. It is typically difficult to dissuade cult stock investors from their beliefs, which is why those stocks get the \u201ccult\u201d label.\n\nI don\u2019t necessarily think Tesla is a typical cult stock. There\u2019s absolutely no rational reason why someone would buy shares of a stock on the day of a stock split that was announced weeks prior. It\u2019s one thing to believe in a long-term technology growth story. It\u2019s another to indiscriminately buy a stock that is up nearly 1,000% in the past year.\n\nThe second reason why I don\u2019t think the \u201ccult\u201d label is appropriate for Tesla is because of the negative connotation of the word. The line between a cult and a religion is often very blurry. However, to me a cult is a belief system that was designed at least in large part to exploit its believers. I\u2019ve seen no evidence that the belief system surrounding Tesla, alternative energy and technology is nefarious at all.\n\nHow to Play TSLA\n\nAt the end of the day, I don\u2019t know if Tesla stock is a religion, a cult, a political movement or a new world order. But I do know one thing. Tesla does not behave like any other auto stock. It does not behave like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) or any other big tech stock.\n\nSomething very unique is going on with Tesla. Until investors know exactly what it is, it\u2019s simply not worth the risk to go long or short.\n\nOn the date of publication, Wayne Duggan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nWayne Duggan has been a U.S. News & World Report Investing contributor since 2016 and is a staff writer at Benzinga, where he has written more than 7,000 articles.

        "text": "Electric vehicle companies are enjoying an incredible moment in 2020, spearheaded by Tesla (TSLA), which saw shares surge 600% from their March lows, and Chinese rival Nio (NIO), also enjoying a similar 700% pop.\n\nInvestors also battled over shares in electric truck maker Nikola (NKLA) earlier this year, which debuted via a special purpose acquisition company (or SPAC) in June as shares spiked about 110% in the week following its debut.\n\nNow, yet another Tesla rival is looking to make its public debut \u2014 this time in the form of Austin, Texas-based electric trucking company Hyliion. The company announced in June it would be following Nikola\u2019s lead by going public via a reverse merger with Tortoise Acquisition Corp. (SHLL) to trade on the New York Stock Exchange in a deal the company said would net $560 million in proceeds. But rather than start by only manufacturing electric trucks from the ground up, Hyliion is taking a different approach by offering to retrofit existing trucks with its electric drivetrain.\n\n\u201cWhat we're doing is actually focusing on the drivetrain of the vehicle as opposed to re-inventing the entire vehicle from the ground up,\u201d Hyliion CEO Thomas Healy tells Yahoo Finance\u2019s YFi PM. \u201cThe benefit of this is it's a lot quicker of a development.\u201d\n\nHyliion plans to retrofit existing trucks with its electric and hybrid drivetrains to convert them into more efficient vehicles.\n\nAs the company approaches its debut that\u2019s planned to take place by the end of the third quarter, shares in Tortoise Acquisition continue to rise \u2014 up more than 300% since the merger was announced, including a 25% spike following Healy\u2019s Tuesday appearance on Yahoo Finance.\n\nAside from its electric \u201ce-axle\u201d drivetrain for existing semi-trucks, Hyliion is also planning to ramp up production of a second offering dubbed the Hypertruck ERX that uses an electric drivetrain and is capable of achieving a net carbon negative emissions footprint by using renewable natural gas. The company says the natural gas-powered onboard generator to recharge the battery allows for more than 1,000 miles of range and will allow truckers to fill up on much more available natural gas filling stations.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cOn that vehicle we actually use an onboard natural gas generator that can kick on and charge the batteries up as you're driving so you don't have to plug it into the grid in order to recharge the battery,\u201d Healy said.\n\nThe company previously announced a 1,000 pre-order for its Hypertrucks from Kuwait-based logistics company Agility. Deliveries of its Hypertruck are planned for 2021 before volume production in 2022. The company says it\u2019s already shipping its hybrid e-axle system before ramping production next year.\n\nZack Guzman is the host of YFi PM as well as a senior writer and on-air reporter covering entrepreneurship, cannabis, startups, and breaking news at Yahoo Finance.

        "text": "Have you ever thought about what your returns would be today if you invested in Tesla Motors (NASDAQ: TSLA) 10 years ago? Tesla Motors is an American electric vehicle and clean energy company that was founded and incorporated on July 1, 2003, by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. Elon Musk was an early investor in Tesla and has served as the CEO and product architect of Tesla Motors since 2008.\n\nThis company specializes in building electric cars, solar and integrated renewable energy solutions for homes and businesses. Tesla is the world's best-selling plug-in and battery electric passenger car manufacturer. Tesla Motors has headquartered in Palo Alto, California, and builds many of its vehicle components in-house, such as batteries, motors, and software.\n\nIn 2010 Tesla Motors purchased the Tesla factory for 42 million in Fremont California. Tesla went on to launch its first initial public offering (IPO) on NASDAQ on June 29, 2010. They issued 13.3 million shares of common stock for the public at a price of $17.00 per share.\n\nOn March 8th, 2011 Tesla shares were sold at an opening price of $4.92 per share. Now a decade later the Tesla share price has skyrocketed up to $563 per share. If you'd invested 1,000 in Tesla Motors, Inc. (TSLA) on March 7, 2011, today that investment would be worth $119,829.66. Your total profit from that investment today would equal $118,829.66 with an annual return of 61.26%.\n\nBack in August, they announced a stock split and since then share prices have increased by nearly 200% on a split-adjusted basis. The overall share price has been steadily increasing over the past few years.\n\nIn 2020, Tesla's global sales reached an all-time high of 499,550 units with a 35.8% increase over the previous year. Tesla broke the record for the greatest value of any American automaker after reaching a market capitalization of $86 billion on January 20th, 2020. Tesla shot up 743% in 2020 alone and their share price reached a peak of $900 at the start of this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nSince reaching that peak back in January, Tesla share prices have dropped by around 38%. Tesla shares have been down by about 16% so far this year. Tesla has definitely had its struggles but the company expects to increase its productivity and volume by 50% each year in the near future. Every stock has had its ups and downs but Tesla Motors has grown to become one of the top electric car manufacturers in the world.\n\nSee more from Benzinga\n\n\u00a9 2021 Benzinga.com.

        "publish_date": "03/10/2021",
        "text": "Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) stock is back in the news following a sell-off over the past few weeks and a bounce higher in the past few days. We'll look at what the options market is expecting in terms of the magnitude of upcoming stock moves. We'll also look at how spreads might be used in a high-premium environment to reduce capital outlay \u2013 whatever your trading view.\n\nTesla options are pricing about a 10% move by March 19th , about $65 in either direction\n\nOptions are pricing about a 14% move into April 1st, a little more than $90 in either direction.\n\nHere's the bullish and bearish consensus with the stock near $665, via Options AI:\n\nOptions are pricing a Bullish Consensus of about $765 and a Bearish Consensus of about $575.\n\nUsing the Expected Move to Help Create Options Spreads\n\nUsing Tesla as an example, we can see how the expected move might be used to help guide strike selection on options spreads, both debit, and credit. We can also see how option spreads can be used to help reduce capital outlay and potentially improve probability of profits (versus buying outright calls or puts).\n\nBullish \u2013 Debit Call Spreads\n\nWith TSLA trading near $665 we can use the 14% expected move (by April 1st) to generate spreads, both debit and credit and then compare those to outright calls and puts. Here's an example of bullish spreads based on the expected move via Options AI:\n\nWe see two credit spreads, and one debit spread. We'll focus first on the April 1st 662.5/755 Debit Call Spread. This spread is trading at approximately $34. Here's how that trade looks on the Options AI chart, with a breakeven near $697:\n\nWith this Debit Call Spread a trader is able to position for a move higher at a cost of about $34. The trade needs the stock to be above approx. $697 on April 1st in order to be profitable.\n\nWith spreads, a trader can directly compare the costs and breakeven (and probability of profit) to a call of a similar price. For instance, the April 1st 700 calls trade at about $39. In other words, a trader can consider a debit call spread, with a breakeven of $697, versus a call, with a breakeven of $739 where the spread is trading at a lower price than the call.\n\nStory continues\n\nHere are those two trades side by side for comparison:\n\nTSLA 662.50/755 call spread (April 1st)\n\nTSLA 700 call (April 1st)\n\nNote that by selling the higher strike call to help finance the purchase of the at-the-money call, the breakeven price (at expiry) can be lowered to a level closer to where the stock is currently trading. This in turn helps increase probability of profit in return for capping potential upside (beyond the bullish expected move).\n\nThe difference in the implied volatility of the at the money call and the out of the money call is not quite as dramatic as a meme stock like Gamestop where a trader would need to go really far out of the money to find a call trading at the same price as a call spread but it it is still relevant. Read here for the specifics on GME and other high volatility stocks.\n\nBearish Debit Spreads \u2013 The same process can be applied to Bearish Debit Spreads, with the TSLA April 1st 670/580 Debit Put spread trading at about $32:\n\nDirectional Credit Spreads\n\nNext, we'll focus on credit spreads. A credit spread an be used to express a directional view by selling premium to others. Using a bullish view as an an example, we can use a credit spread to \"sell to the bears\". This trade is bullish, but may be best though of as being bullish, by not being bearish:\n\nAgain, the expected move can help with strike selection for those looking to set their credit spread at the bearish consensus:\n\nIn this example, the credit spread collects about $215, as long as the stock is above $568 on expiry. With this credit spread, more has to be risked ($785) than the potential reward ($215). But, because the trade only needs the stock to be above approx. $568 on expiry, it carries a higher probability of profit.\n\nThis \"bullish by not being bearish\" stance is one way traders can express a view in a $600 dollar stock without the higher costs associated of trading options nearer to the current stock price. On a credit spread, the defined \u2018risk', can be thought of similarly to the \u2018cost' one would associate with a long option or a debit spread.\n\nRemember, this should be balanced with an understanding of other risks specific to spreads (such as assignment and execution risk).\n\nBearish Credit Call Spread \u2013 The same view can be expressed for bearish positioning, in this case with the April 1st -765/+770 credit call spread:\n\nIron Condors \u2013 Using the expected move to sell a credit to both the Bulls and the Bears\n\nFinally, let's consider the scenario where a trader believes that the options market is overpricing the move in both directions and believes that a stock will stay within the expected move. Rather than not bearish\" or not bullish like the directional Credit Spreads above, this trade, an Iron Condor, \u2018sells the move' to both the bulls and the bears. An an example, here's an Iron Condor, selling at a $1 credit:\n\nThe Iron condor, which involves simultaneously selling an out-the-money Credit Call Spread and Credit Put Spread seeks to collect the premium (income) received if the stock stays within its expected move.\n\nAn Iron Condor is a strategy some traders utilize when they expect implied volatility to go lower. But in this case, with so little time to expiration, the best way to think of this strategy is that if the stock stays within the expected move, it is profitable. If the stock moves beyond the expected move, it is unprofitable.\n\nNote\n\nPlease note, any stocks and/or trading strategies referenced are for informational and educational purposes only and should in no way be construed as recommendations.

Traditional automakers like Ford (F) and Volkswagen also pose a threat to the world leader in EV sales. And then there\u2019s potentially Tesla\u2019s biggest eventual rival: Apple and its own EV ambitions.\n\nTesla clawed its way to the top of the EV market through the sheer will of outspoken, and often mercurial, CEO Elon Musk. And while, as of Tuesday, Tesla\u2019s stock price dropped as much as 18% in the last month following its $1.5 billion bitcoin bet, the company is still up 319% in the last 12 months.\n\nBut it\u2019s going to need much more than a charismatic leader and rabid fan base to maintain its lead in the coming years. According to Deloitte Insights, EVs will make up 32% of new car sales by 2030, up from just over 2.5% in 2020 \u2014 meaning there\u2019s plenty of space for competitors.\n\nAn unsold 2021 Model X sports-utility vehicle sits at a Tesla dealership Sunday, Jan. 24, 2021, in Littleton, Colo. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski)\n\n\u201cTesla has lots...of competition,\u201d Craig Irwin of Roth Capital Partners told Yahoo Finance. \u201cThere are companies that have superior technology in autonomous, there are companies that have superior technology in batteries, there are companies that have superior technology in electric vehicles. Tesla has great cars, don't get me wrong, but you're going to see a number of very exciting developments over the course of the next year.\u201d\n\nSo how can Tesla hold onto its lead? By continuing to press its global expansion into India, and ensuring its secret sauce \u2014 its technical prowess \u2014 stays ahead of its rivals. But the increasingly crowded market for EV vehicles could throw some obstacles in Tesla\u2019s path.\n\nStory continues\n\nHow Tesla can hold its lead\n\nFor Tesla, global expansion is the easiest way to keep pace with the new crop of competitors, and it\u2019s made progress on that front. The company has already rolled out its vehicles and built a plant in China, and is in the midst of constructing its first European plant in Germany.\n\nTesla also has the advantage of understanding the difficulties of bringing its own manufacturing capabilities online. The company went through what Musk called \u201cproduction Hell\u201d when getting its Model 3 assembly line up and running in 2018. The firm was just weeks from going under during the build up, and in a recent tweet Musk revealed that during the buildout he tried getting in touch with Apple CEO Tim Cook to sell the automaker.\n\nWhile Tesla\u2019s move into China was crucial because the country has the world\u2019s largest car market, its next move into India, also one of the world\u2019s largest markets, will be nearly as important for the company\u2019s continued growth.\n\n\u201cThe key development this year is the start of sales into India,\u201d Irwin noted, adding that he\u2019s heard \u201cchatter\u201d that Tesla has already selected a site for the Indian factory.\n\nLucid's Air Dream is the automaker's top-of-the-line vehicle, and, according to the company, outclasses Tesla's Model S in terms of range. (Image: Lucid)\n\nTesla, which was down just over 2% as of market close Tuesday, also needs to ensure it doesn\u2019t get caught up in its recent move into bitcoin (BTC-USD). The company put $1.5 billion of its cash into the cryptocurrency, helping to send bitcoin soaring even higher. And while it saw roughly $1 billion in profits on paper, Musk\u2019s subsequent statements on the cryptocurrency may have helped send its price down.\n\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives, however, warns that Tesla\u2019s crypto play shouldn\u2019t distract investors from the company\u2019s overall efforts.\n\n\u201cThis is a golden age of EVs and we forecast that $5 trillion will be spent over the next decade,\u201d Ives told Yahoo Finance. \u201cEV, led by Tesla, is changing the way investors value these companies going forward. It\u2019s not your grandfather\u2019s auto industry anymore, as Detroit is showing on EVs.\u201d\n\nBesides, there are plenty of other companies taking aim at Tesla in the meantime.\n\nTesla\u2019s coming competition\n\nLucid Motors revealed Monday it was going public via a reverse merger with special-purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, Churchill Capital IV (CCIV). The deal values Lucid at a whopping $24 billion and will provide the upstart automaker with $4.4 billion to expand its Arizona-based plant.\n\nLucid aims to get its high-end luxury sedan, the Lucid Air, on the road this year, and eventually have the Arizona plant pumping out as many as 365,000 units a year. The company is also working on production of its luxury SUV, the Lucid Gravity, which is set to launch in 2023.\n\nThe Lucid Air Dream is Lucid\u2019s top-of-the-line model priced at $161,500, well above the $119,900 Tesla Model S Plaid. \u201cOur first product is unashamedly a luxury car that will compete with the Mercedes Benz S-Class at the top table,\u201d CEO Peter Rawlinson told Yahoo Finance Live Monday. \u201cAnd currently there isn\u2019t an EV offering in the true luxury arena.\u201d\n\nWhat makes Lucid so impressive is that, according to its own number, it already outclasses Tesla in terms of battery performance. With an estimated range of 503 miles per charge, the Dream\u2019s battery can also be charged to 300 miles in just 20 minutes. Tesla\u2019s long-range Model S, meanwhile, gets just 412 miles on a charge, and can be charged with up to only 200 miles of power in 15 minutes.\n\nR.J. Scaringe, Rivian's 35-year-old CEO, introduces his company's R1T all-electric pickup truck and all-electric R1S SUV at Los Angeles Auto Show in Los Angeles, California, U.S. November 27, 2018. REUTERS/Mike Blake\n\nLucid is not the only competitor coming after Tesla, of course. Rivian is also set to launch its long-awaited electric truck this year, with backing from heavyweights including Amazon, which is preparing a fleet of Rivian-based electric delivery vehicles. Rivian also has the backing of Ford, which will use Rivian technology in its own offerings. The company promises more than 300 miles of range in its R1T truck with a starting price of $67,500.\n\nRivian is also expected to IPO this year at an estimated valuation of $50 billion, according to Bloomberg. That company is powering out of the gate with an electric truck, setting up stiff competition for Tesla\u2019s upcoming Cybertruck, which is also launching this year.\n\nTesla has even managed to inspire an electric truck company fittingly called Nikola (NKLA) \u2014 Tesla is named after the inventor Nikola Tesla \u2014 though that firm was blasted in a report from short seller Hindenburg accusing it of being a fraud. (Nikola denied the report and called it a \u201chit job.\u201d)\n\nTraditional automakers entering the space include Ford, which will launch its highly anticipated Mustang Mach-E crossover in the coming months at a starting price of $42,895 and upwards of 250 miles per charge. Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategies says that Volkswagen could become a Tesla rival, too, noting that a large automaker could, in a few years, become the No. 2 EV automaker after Musk\u2019s company.\n\nThen there\u2019s Apple, which is rumored to be teaming up with an established automaker like Hyundai, on an electric vehicle of its own. Still, details on how Apple will actually manufacture the car are scant, and it isn\u2019t expected to hit the market until 2024.\n\nBut Apple is just one part of the bigger picture, which is this: The EV field is becoming crowded. Tesla may have the best-selling EV of all time, by a wide margin, as my colleague Rick Newman pointed out, but the flurry of new competitors may expose its weak points.\n\nThose flaws include an unpredictable CEO who was sued by the SEC over a tweet saying he had funding to take Tesla private, as well as fatal car crashes that have invited scrutiny into its autopilot system. Tesla may still be the EV leader despite these flaws \u2014 but now is not the time for Elon Musk to take his empire for granted.\n\nBy Daniel Howley, tech editor. Follow him at @DanielHowley"

It comes after CEO Elon Musk warned that the prospect of recession and higher interest rates meant it could lower prices to sustain growth at the expense of profit.\n\nMusk acknowledged last year that prices had become \"embarrassingly high\" and could hurt demand. Shares ended down 0.9% after falling as much as 6.4% on Friday. Last year, Tesla stock had its worst year since the company's inception due to slowing growth in China and Musk's distraction with Twitter.\n\nTesla lowered prices across the United States, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, following a series of cuts last week in Asia, in what analysts saw as a clear shot at both smaller rivals that have been bleeding cash and legacy automakers aggressively ramping up electric vehicle production.\n\n\u201cCompetition is coming and they are responding with price cuts,\u201d said Thomas Hayes, chairman and managing member at Great Hill Capital.\n\nThe discounts may make EV cars affordable to people who were previously priced out of the market. U.S. and French buyers could take advantage of both the discounts and federal tax credits available in both countries for certain electric vehicle purchases.\n\nThe U.S. price cuts on Tesla's global top-sellers the Model 3 sedan and Model Y crossover SUV were between 6% and 20%, Reuters calculations showed, with the basic Model Y now costing $52,990, down from $65,990.\n\nThose cuts are before a $7,500 U.S. federal tax credit that took effect for many electric vehicles on Jan. 1 that could bring discounts to more than 30%.\n\nTesla also cut prices for its Model X luxury crossover SUV and Model S sedan in the United States.\n\nReuters Graphics Reuters Graphics\n\nDISCOUNTS KICK IN MORE SUBSIDIES IN FRANCE, U.S.\n\nA spokesperson for Tesla Germany said lower cost inflation was also a factor in reducing prices in its top European market, without specifying which costs had fallen.\n\nIn Germany, Tesla lopped prices by about 1% to almost 17% on the Model 3 and the Model Y. The best-selling Model Y will now go for 44,890 euros ($48,499), down 9,100 euros.\n\nIt also reduced prices in Austria, Switzerland and France.\n\nIn France, customers buying the Model 3 for 44,990 euros will now get a further reduction through a government subsidy of 5,000 euros on an EV scheme with a threshold of 47,000 euros.\n\nThe move broadens the vehicles in Tesla's line-up eligible for the Biden administration tax credit.\n\nA new Tesla Model 3 is shown at a delivery center on the last day of the company's third quarter, in San Diego, California, September 30, 2019. REUTERS/Mike Blake Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nBefore the price cut, the five-seat version of the Model Y had been ineligible, which Musk called \"messed up.\" After the price cut, the long-range version of the Model Y will qualify.\n\nDeutsche Bank estimated that a Model Y, after tax credits, could be $18,000 less than Ford's rival Mustang Mach E. Tesla's vehicle gross profit margins, which are among the highest in the industry, would drop 3 percentage points in 2023 versus 2022, it estimated, but Tesla's \"bold offensive move\" secured growth and put competitors in great difficulty, the broker said.\n\nWhile Tesla shares fell, stocks of rivals were hit even harder.\n\nU.S. automakers General Motors Co (GM.N) and Ford Motor Co (F.N) fell 4.5% and 6%, respectively, making them among the biggest losers on the broad-market S&P 500 Index, while in Europe, Stellantis NV (STLA.MI) fell 3.7% and Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) dropped 3.6%.\n\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives said the move could boost global deliveries by 12% to 15% this year and shows Musk responding to growing competition.\n\nReuters Graphics\n\n'PUNCH IN THE GUT'\n\nTesla fans and customers complained the price cuts disadvantaged those who had recently bought a vehicle.\n\nGreg Woodfill in Seattle, who bought a Model Y in December, had considered waiting until the new year to get the U.S. subsidy, but was lured by a discount at the time of $3,750.\n\nThe Tesla fan, who had previously owned a Model 3, said he was disenchanted with Musk's antics but decided to buy a Model Y because he loved Tesla products.\n\n\"It's a punch in the gut, to be honest,\" he told Reuters on Friday, adding that it feels unfair Tesla sought to boost fourth-quarter sales with discounts, only to cut prices even more a month later.\n\n\"If they knew they would drop the price this much, they should have just done it in December.\"\n\nIn China, where Tesla cut prices last week by 6-13.5%, owners protested at delivery centres, calling for compensation.\n\nFor 2021, the United States and China combined had accounted for about 75% of Tesla sales, but it has been growing in Europe.\n\nTesla cut prices in China and other Asian markets last week, which analysts had said would boost demand and increase pressure on rivals, including BYD (002594.SZ), to follow suit in what could become a price war in the largest single EV market.\n\nTesla shares under pressure\n\n($1 = 0.9224 euro)\n\nReporting by Hyunjoo Jin in Seoul, Zhang Yan in Shanghai and Victoria Waldersee in Berlin Additional reporting by Bansari Mayur Kamdar in Bengaluru, Samuel Indyk in London and Gertrude Chavez in New York; Writing by Kevin Krolicki and Josephine Mason Editing by Peter Henderson, Alexander Smith and Matthew Lewis\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

        "publish_date": "10/04/2022",
        "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 4 (Reuters) - As recently as July, Tesla (TSLA.O) Chief Executive Elon Musk said the electric-car maker did not have a problem with customer demand, simply a problem making and shipping all the Model Ys and Model 3s consumers were ready to buy.\n\nThat may no longer be true.\n\nAnalysts see early signs of caution for the world's most valuable car maker, including for its increasingly premium pricing, at a time when the global economy is slowing and expectations for global auto sales are being dialed back.\n\nTesla has navigated supply-chain challenges better than most of its rivals and analysts expect it to post strong growth through next year as it expands output, but there are also indications it is being forced to respond to a tougher market.\n\nThe most immediate concern: Tesla made over 22,000 more EVs than it delivered to customers in the third quarter, data released this week showed. That is the first time it has had to finance that many cars in inventory.\n\nFor most of the past three years, Tesla has been selling more EVs in a quarter than it can produce. The one notable exception was in early 2020 when COVID disrupted deliveries.\n\nWhile Tesla's numbers remain low, building inventory has historically been a down-cycle indicator for automakers, forcing markdowns in past recessions of the kind Tesla has not yet faced.\n\nTesla blamed transport issues for a delivery total that fell short of Wall Street expectations.\n\nIf Tesla needs to hold more inventory in coming quarters to smooth deliveries and avoid the end-of-quarter rush that has been its norm, that would add to the $1.2-billion in undelivered cars it held at the end of the second quarter.\n\nAnalysts believe Tesla still has more demand than it can supply, the bedrock assumption behind its aggressive expansion plan over the next year as it ramps up production at factories in Shanghai, Berlin and Austin, Texas.\n\nMorgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said he believed Tesla did not face an immediate demand problem, but added a caution on pricing and Tesla's ability to buck the economic cycle.\n\n\"It would be unreasonable to assume that there is: (a) a limit to how much Tesla can continue to increase prices without demand suffering and (b) that the company was not exposed to decelerating macroeconomic growth,\u201d he said in a research note.\n\n[1/2]A Tesla model 3 car is seen in their showroom in Singapore October 22, 2021. Picture taken October 22, 2021. REUTERS/Edgar Su/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nTesla's average vehicle transaction price jumped 31% to $69,831 in August, compared with $53,132 at the start of 2021, according to Kelly Blue Book. That outpaced industry-wide price hikes on new cars of 18% to $48,301 during the same period.\n\nReuters Graphics\n\nThe waiting time Tesla customers face between order and delivery has also been dropping in both the United States and China, Tesla's largest markets. In China, that lag, one indicator of the supply-demand balance, has been cut four times since August to a minimum of a week for delivery.\n\nAnd Tesla, which has resisted marketing and incentives, offered Chinese buyers a rebate of 8,000 yuan ($1,100) if they took delivery before the end of September.\n\nMusk himself in July said Tesla prices were hitting \"embarrassing levels\" and that \"demand falls off a cliff\" when prices are rising to \"some arbitrarily high level.\"\n\nAs Tesla pushes its own capacity expansion, it is running into a wave of new EV competition, especially in China from the likes of BYD(002594.SZ), Nio (9866.HK) and Xpeng(9868.HK).\n\nA Tesla output plan reported last week by Reuters, before the third quarter delivery announcement, showed the automaker\u2019s detailed plan to run and source its factories to hit output growth of 50% this year and next, a target just beyond the most bullish outside forecasts.\n\nThe question of whether and how Tesla sees the supply-demand balance shifting will be central for investors when the company reports quarterly results on Oct 19.\n\nMusk has offered an evolving view on economic risks. In June, he told Tesla staff he had a \"super bad feeling\" about the economy, a reason he cited to pause hiring at the time. In August, he told investors he expected a \"mild recession\" that could last up to 18 months.\n\nGuidehouse Insights analyst Sam Abuelsamid said Tesla needed to get higher production from its newer factories in Austin and Berlin. Musk had earlier compared the start of production in those plants to \"gigantic money furnaces.\"\n\n\"Tesla could end up running into some financial challenges in the third and fourth quarters (of 2023), if those factories continue to be underutilized,\" Abuelsamid said.\n\nFitch Solutions, which provides research on country risk and industries, said on Tuesday it expected global auto sales to drop 5.4% in 2022, before bouncing back only partly in 2023.\n\nReporting by Hyunjoo Jin, editing by Kevin Krolicki and Nick Zieminski\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

REUTERS/Evgenia Novozhenina/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nJan 17 (Reuters) - A 2016 video that Tesla (TSLA.O) used to promote its self-driving technology was staged to show capabilities like stopping at a red light and accelerating at a green light that the system did not have, according to testimony by a senior engineer.\n\nThe video, which remains archived on Tesla\u2019s website, was released in October 2016 and promoted on Twitter by Chief Executive Elon Musk as evidence that \u201cTesla drives itself.\u201d\n\nBut the Model X was not driving itself with technology Tesla had deployed, Ashok Elluswamy, director of Autopilot software at Tesla, said in the transcript of a July deposition taken as evidence in a lawsuit against Tesla for a 2018 fatal crash involving a former Apple (AAPL.O) engineer.\n\nThe previously unreported testimony by Elluswamy represents the first time a Tesla employee has confirmed and detailed how the video was produced.\n\nThe video carries a tagline saying: \u201cThe person in the driver\u2019s seat is only there for legal reasons. He is not doing anything. The car is driving itself.\u201d\n\nElluswamy said Tesla\u2019s Autopilot team set out to engineer and record a \u201cdemonstration of the system\u2019s capabilities\u201d at the request of Musk.\n\nElluswamy, Musk and Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. However, the company has warned drivers that they must keep their hands on the wheel and maintain control of their vehicles while using Autopilot.\n\nThe Tesla technology is designed to assist with steering, braking, speed and lane changes but its features \u201cdo not make the vehicle autonomous,\u201d the company says on its website.\n\nTo create the video, the Tesla used 3D mapping on a predetermined route from a house in Menlo Park, California, to Tesla\u2019s then-headquarters in Palo Alto, he said.\n\nDrivers intervened to take control in test runs, he said. When trying to show the Model X could park itself with no driver, a test car crashed into a fence in Tesla\u2019s parking lot, he said.\n\n\u201cThe intent of the video was not to accurately portray what was available for customers in 2016. It was to portray what was possible to build into the system,\u201d Elluswamy said, according to a transcript of his testimony seen by Reuters.\n\nWhen Tesla released the video, Musk tweeted, \u201cTesla drives itself (no human input at all) thru urban streets to highway to streets, then finds a parking spot.\u201d\n\nTesla faces lawsuits and regulatory scrutiny over its driver assistance systems.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice began a criminal investigation into Tesla\u2019s claims that its electric vehicles can drive themselves in 2021, after a number of crashes, some of them fatal, involving Autopilot, Reuters has reported.\n\nThe New York Times reported in 2021 that Tesla engineers had created the 2016 video to promote Autopilot without disclosing that the route had been mapped in advance or that a car had crashed in trying to complete the shoot, citing anonymous sources.\n\nWhen asked if the 2016 video showed the performance of the Tesla Autopilot system available in a production car at the time, Elluswamy said, \"It does not.\"\n\nElluswamy was deposed in a lawsuit against Tesla over a 2018 crash in Mountain View, California, that killed Apple engineer Walter Huang.\n\nAndrew McDevitt, the lawyer who represents Huang\u2019s wife and who questioned Elluswamy\u2019s in July, told Reuters it was \u201cobviously misleading to feature that video without any disclaimer or asterisk.\u201d\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board concluded in 2020 that Huang\u2019s fatal crash was likely caused by his distraction and the limitations of Autopilot. It said Tesla\u2019s \u201cineffective monitoring of driver engagement\u201d had contributed to the crash.\n\nElluswamy said drivers could \u201cfool the system,\u201d making a Tesla system believe that they were paying attention based on feedback from the steering wheel when they were not. But he said he saw no safety issue with Autopilot if drivers were paying attention.\n\nReporting by Hyunjoo Jin; Editing by Kevin Krolicki and Lisa Shumaker\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

REUTERS/Edgar Su Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nOct 20 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) said on Wednesday it expected to miss its vehicle delivery target this year, but downplayed concerns about softening demand after its revenue missed Wall Street estimates.\n\nChief Executive Elon Musk told analysts on a conference call there was excellent demand in the fourth quarter, addressing investors' concerns that buyers could be discouraged by the weak global economy and high prices for Tesla vehicles.\n\nBut Tesla said some logistics challenges would persist, with fourth-quarter deliveries growing by less than 50% while production rose 50%.\n\n\"I wouldn't say we're recession proof, but it's certainly recession resilient,\" Musk said.\n\nPreviously, Tesla had repeatedly said it was aiming for 50% growth this year from the 936,172 cars it delivered in 2021.\n\nIts shares were down nearly 6% in after-market trading.\n\nTesla is expanding fast despite global economic jitters, and investors are closely watching for signs that consumer demand is cooling as inflation surges and interest rates climb.\n\n\"This quarter was not rainbows and roses and it leaves investors wanting more from Tesla which is held to a higher standard than every other automaker,\" Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a client note.\n\n\"Tesla must now prove again to the Street that the robust growth story is running into a myriad of logistics issues as opposed to demand softening with EV competition coming all angles around the globe.\"\n\nThe electric carmaker's third-quarter automotive gross margin was 27.9%, missing analysts' estimates and down from 30.5% a year earlier.\n\nRevenue for the third quarter was $21.45 billion, a record but short of analysts' estimates of $21.96 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\n\nThe company said it had a negative foreign exchange impact of $250 million on its earnings as the U.S. dollar strengthened against other major currencies.\n\n\"Raw material cost inflation impacted our profitability along with ramp inefficiencies\" from its new factories in Berlin and Texas, and the production of its new 4680 batteries, according to Tesla's statement. Musk added that production of the 4680 battery was gaining rapid traction, although executive Andrew Baglino said, \"There are challenges still ahead that we have not yet surpassed. No doubt.\"\n\nMusk added that Tesla's Semi trucks, which would start to be delivered to customers beginning this December, will not use the 4680 battery cells.\n\nMusk also said the company has the ability to do a stock buyback in the range of $5 billion to $10 billion, pending board review and approval.\n\nPATH TO PASS APPLE MARKET SHARE\n\nEarly this month, Tesla said it delivered 35% more vehicles in the July-September period than in the previous quarter, thanks in part to a rebound in China output after lengthy COVID-19 disruptions, but the record number was shy of vehicle production and analysts' estimates.\n\nThe electric vehicle pioneer has seen its shares tumble about 50% from record highs last November as investors were spooked by fears of a global economic slowdown and Musk's bid to buy social media company Twitter (TWTR.N).\n\nMusk told the conference call he saw a path for Tesla to be worth more than two mammoth companies, Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Saudi Aramco (2222.SE), combined. Tesla's market cap is now under $700 billion, while Apple is worth $2.3 trillion and oil producer Saudi Aramco is worth $2.1 trillion.\n\nAnalysts had expected Musk to voice optimism about Tesla in the conference call. Musk has been trying to raise cash to fund his $44 billion deal to take Twitter Inc private. Some experts say Musk may need to sell about $3 billion more in stock after the earnings announcement to help fund the deal.\n\nMusk on Wednesday said he was excited about his pending acquisition of Twitter Inc (TWTR.N), though he said he and other investors were overpaying for the social media company.\n\nMusk also said Tesla's Cybertruck pick-up truck was on track to enter production in the middle of next year and its heavy duty semi truck could see 50,000 units in North America in 2024.\n\nReporting by Akash Sriram in Bengaluru and Hyunjoo Jin and Noel Randewich in San Francisco; Editing by Peter Henderson, Chris Reese and Mark Potter\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

It raised the credit to $7,500 on Wednesday. It also recently started offering free supercharging for 10,000 miles (16,093 kms) for vehicles delivered in December.\n\nThe rare discounts follow a series of price hikes over the past couple of years by Tesla, which blamed supply chain disruption and inflation.\n\nShares of Tesla ended down 8.9%, heading for their worst month ever as worries grow over softening demand for electric cars and Chief Executive Elon Musk's distraction with Twitter, which he purchased in October.\n\nTesla underperformed the broader market, which fell as data showing a resilient economy fueled worries over the Federal Reserve's path on hiking interest rates.\n\nMusk said on Thursday that he foresees the economy will be in a \"serious recession\" in 2023 and demand for big-ticket items will be lower.\n\nA Tesla Model 3 is seen in a showroom in Los Angeles, California U.S. January 12, 2018.

On a conference call that year, Elon Musk, the Silicon Valley automaker\u2019s chief executive, described it as \u201cprobably better\u201d than a human driver.\n\nLast week, Musk said on another call Tesla would soon release an upgraded version of \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d software allowing customers to travel \u201cto your work, your friend\u2019s house, to the grocery store without you touching the wheel.\u201d\n\nA video currently on the company\u2019s website says: \u201cThe person in the driver\u2019s seat is only there for legal reasons. He is not doing anything. The car is driving itself.\u201d\n\nHowever, the company also has explicitly warned drivers that they must keep their hands on the wheel and maintain control of their vehicles while using Autopilot.\n\nThe Tesla technology is designed to assist with steering, braking, speed and lane changes but its features \u201cdo not make the vehicle autonomous,\u201d the company says on its website.\n\nSuch warnings could complicate any case the Justice Department might wish to bring, the sources said.\n\nTesla, which disbanded its media relations department in 2020, did not respond to written questions from Reuters on Wednesday. Musk also did not respond to written questions seeking comment. A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nMusk said in an interview with Automotive News in 2020 that Autopilot problems stem from customers using the system in ways contrary to Tesla\u2019s instructions.\n\nFederal and California safety regulators are already scrutinizing whether claims about Autopilot's capabilities and the system's design imbue customers with a false sense of security, inducing them to treat Teslas as truly driverless cars and become complacent behind the wheel with potentially deadly consequences.\n\nThe Justice Department investigation potentially represents a more serious level of scrutiny because of the possibility of criminal charges against the company or individual executives, the people familiar with the inquiry said.\n\n[1/2]A Tesla Model 3 vehicle drives on autopilot along the 405 highway in Westminster, California, U.S., March 16, 2022. REUTERS/Mike Blake Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nAs part of the latest probe, Justice Department prosecutors in Washington and San Francisco are examining whether Tesla misled consumers, investors and regulators by making unsupported claims about its driver assistance technology's capabilities, the sources said.\n\nOfficials conducting their inquiry could ultimately pursue criminal charges, seek civil sanctions or close the probe without taking any action, they said.\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s Autopilot probe is far from recommending any action partly because it is competing with two other DOJ investigations involving Tesla, one of the sources said. Investigators still have much work to do and no decision on charges is imminent, this source said.\n\nThe Justice Department may also face challenges in building its case, said the sources, because of Tesla\u2019s warnings about overreliance on Autopilot.\n\nFor instance, after telling the investor call last week that Teslas would soon travel without customers touching controls, Musk added that the vehicles still needed someone in the driver\u2019s seat. \u201cLike we\u2019re not saying that that\u2019s quite ready to have no one behind the wheel,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Tesla website also cautions that, before enabling Autopilot, the driver first needs to agree to \"keep your hands on the steering wheel at all times\" and to always \"maintain control and responsibility for your vehicle.\u201d\n\nBarbara McQuade, a former U.S. attorney in Detroit who prosecuted automotive companies and employees in fraud cases and is not involved in the current probe, said investigators likely would need to uncover evidence such as emails or other internal communications showing that Tesla and Musk made misleading statements about Autopilot\u2019s capabilities on purpose.\n\nSEVERAL PROBES\n\nThe criminal Autopilot investigation adds to the other probes and legal issues involving Musk, who became locked in a court battle earlier this year after abandoning a $44 billion takeover of social media giant Twitter Inc, only to reverse course and proclaim excitement for the looming acquisition.\n\nIn August 2021, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration opened an investigation into a series of crashes, one of them fatal, involving Teslas equipped with Autopilot slamming into parked emergency vehicles.\n\nNHTSA officials in June intensified their probe, which covers 830,000 Teslas with Autopilot, identifying 16 crashes involving the company\u2019s electric cars and stationary first-responder and road maintenance vehicles. The move is a step that regulators must take before requesting a recall. The agency had no immediate comment.\n\nIn July this year, the California Department of Motor Vehicles accused Tesla of falsely advertising its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving capability as providing autonomous vehicle control. Tesla filed paperwork with the agency seeking a hearing on the allegations and indicated it intends to defend against them. The DMV said in a statement it is currently in the discovery stage of the proceeding and declined further comment.\n\nAdditional reporting by Hyunjoo Jin and David Shepardson; Editing by Deepa Babington\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

The overall used car market posted a 4% drop during that period, according to Edmunds data. The used Teslas were in dealer inventory for 50 days on average in November, compared with 38 days for all used cars.\n\nRising gasoline prices, an effect of the Ukraine war, boosted demand for Teslas, one of few long-range electric vehicles in the market. Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) itself raised prices faster than prices for other cars, building its profit margins. And buyers of some new Teslas took advantage of the booming market to sell their relatively new cars for a profit, then order new ones, driving demand for Tesla's new cars.\n\nNow fuel prices are easing, interest rates are rising, Tesla output is increasing, and EV competition is growing, leading used Tesla prices to fall faster than the market, and creating a cascading effect on prices of new Teslas.\n\nTesla last week doubled a U.S. new-car price cut to $7,500 for Model Ys and Model 3s delivered this year, adding to investor jitters about softening demand.\n\nNearly a third of used Teslas for sale in August were 2022 models up for resale, a sign that original buyers were aiming to flip, analysts said.

The company said it maintains a long-term target of a compounded 50% annual rise in sales.\n\nMusk addressed the issue at the start of a call with investors and analysts.\n\n\"These price changes really make a difference for the average consumer,\" he said, adding that vehicle orders were roughly double production in January, leading the automaker to make small price increases for the Model Y SUV.\n\nHe said he expected a \"pretty difficult recession this year,\" but demand for Tesla vehicles \"will be good despite probably a contraction in the automotive market as a whole.\"\n\nShares rose 5.3% in extended trading.\n\nCYBERTRUCK\n\nThe company is relying on older products and Musk said its Cybertruck, its next new electric pickup truck, would not begin volume production until next year.

Tesla, which had made a series of price increases since early 2021, reversed course and offered discounts in December in the United States, followed by price cuts of as much as 20% this month.\n\nAnalysts had said Tesla's profitability gave it room to cut prices and pressure rivals.

THIS IMAGE HAS BEEN SUPPLIED BY A THIRD PARTY. NO RESALES. NO ARCHIVES. Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nSHANGHAI, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Hundreds of Tesla (TSLA.O) owners gathered at the automaker's showrooms and distribution centres in China over the weekend, demanding rebates and credit after sudden price cuts they said meant they had overpaid for electric cars they bought earlier.\n\nOn Saturday, about 200 recent buyers of the Tesla Model Y and Model 3 gathered at a Tesla delivery centre in Shanghai to protest against the U.S. carmaker's decision to slash prices for the second time in three months on Friday.\n\nMany said they had believed that prices Tesla charged for its cars late last year would not be cut as abruptly or as deeply as the automaker just announced in a move to spur sales and support production at its Shanghai plant. The scheduled expiration of a government subsidy at the end of 2022 also drove many to finalize their purchases.\n\nVideos posted on social media showed crowds at Tesla stores and delivery centres in other Chinese cities from Chengdu to Shenzhen, suggesting wider consumer backlash.\n\nAfter Friday's surprise discounts, Tesla's EV prices in China are now between 13% and 24% below their September levels.\n\nAnalysts have said Tesla's move was likely to boost its sales, which tumbled in December, and force other EV makers to cut prices too at a time of faltering demand in the world's largest market for battery-powered cars.\n\nWhile established automakers often discount to manage inventory and keep factories running when demand weakens, Tesla operates without dealerships and transparent pricing has been part of its brand image.\n\n\"It may be a normal business practice but this is not how a responsible enterprise should behave,\" said one Tesla owner protesting at the company's delivery centre in Shanghai's Minhang suburb on Saturday who gave his surname as Zhang.\n\nHe and the other Tesla owners, who said they had taken delivery in the final months of 2022, said they were frustrated with the abruptness of Friday's price cut and Tesla's lack of an explanation to recent buyers.\n\nZhang said police facilitated a meeting between Tesla staff and the assembled owners at which the owners handed over a list of demands, including an apology and compensation or other credits. He added the Tesla staff had agreed to respond by Tuesday.\n\nAbout a dozen police officers could be seen at the Shanghai protest and most of the videos of the other demonstrations also showed a large police presence at the Tesla sites.\n\nProtests are not a rare occurrence in China, which has over the years seen people come out in large numbers over issues such as financial or property scams, but authorities have been on higher alert after widespread protests in Chinese cities and top universities at the end of November against COVID-19 restrictions.\n\n'RETURN THE MONEY'\n\nOther videos appearing to be of Tesla owners protesting were also posted to Chinese social media platforms on Saturday.\n\nOne video, which Reuters verified was filmed at a Tesla store in the southwestern city of Chengdu, showed a crowd chanting, \"Return the money, refund our cars.\"\n\nAnother, which appeared to be filmed in Beijing, showed police cars arriving to disperse crowds outside a Tesla store.\n\nReuters was unable to verify the content of either video.\n\nTesla does not plan to compensate buyers who took delivery before the most recent price cut, a spokesman for Tesla China told Reuters on Saturday.\n\nHe did not respond when asked to comment on the protests.\n\nChina accounted for about a third of Tesla's global sales in 2021 and its Shanghai factory, which employs about 20,000 workers, is its single most productive and profitable plant.\n\nAnalysts have been positive about the potential for Tesla's price cuts to drive sales growth at a time when it is a year from announcing its next new vehicle, the Cybertruck.\n\n\"Nowhere else in the world is Tesla faced with the kind of competitors that they have here [in China],\" said Bill Russo, head of consultancy Automobility Ltd in Shanghai.\n\n\"They are in a much bigger EV market with companies that can price more aggressively than they can, until now.\"\n\nIn 2021, Tesla faced a public relations storm after an unhappy customer climbed on a car at the Shanghai auto show to protest against the company's handling of her complaints about her car's brakes.\n\nTesla responded by apologising to Chinese consumers for not addressing the complaints in a timely way.\n\nReporting by Brenda Goh, Zhang Yan and Casey Hall Editing by Kevin Krolicki and Tomasz Janowski\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

        "text": "Oct 25 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) surpassed $1 trillion in market value on Monday after landing its biggest-ever order from rental car company Hertz, a deal that reinforced the electric car leader's ambitions to top the entire auto industry in sales over the next decade.\n\nTesla shares surged as much as 14.9% to $1,045.02, making it the world's most valuable automaker according to Reuters calculations based on its latest filing.\n\nEven Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk expressed surprise at the velocity of the surge. \"Strange that moved valuation, as Tesla is very much a production ramp problem, not a demand problem,\" Musk tweeted in reply to a comment by Ross Gerber, co-founder of the investment fund Gerber Kawasaki and a Tesla shareholder.\n\n\"Wild $T1mes!\" Musk wrote in a separate tweet.\n\nloading\n\nTesla is the first carmaker to join the elite club of trillion-dollar companies that includes Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O).\n\nMost automakers do not boast about sales to rental car companies, often made at discounts to unload slow-selling models. But for Tesla and its investors, Hertz's decision to order 100,000 Tesla vehicles by the end of 2022 showed electric vehicles are no longer a niche product, but will dominate the mass car market in the near future.\n\n\"Electric vehicles are now mainstream, and we've only just begun to see rising global demand and interest,\" Hertz interim Chief Executive Officer Mark Fields told Reuters.\n\nTesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has set an annual sales growth target of 50%, on average, eventually reaching 20 million vehicles a year. That would be more than twice the volume of current sales leaders Volkswagen AG and Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T).\n\nConsumer demand for electric vehicles is turning a corner in some major markets. The Tesla Model 3 was the best-selling vehicle of any kind in Europe last month, consulting firm JATO Dynamics reported Monday.\n\nTesla also appeared on Monday to be making progress resolving regulatory problems that threatened its business in China. The company said it had opened a new data and research center in Shanghai to comply with government requirements that data collected from vehicles in China stay in the country.\n\nHowever, Tesla faced new U.S. regulatory pressure on Monday. The National Transportation Safety Board's new chief sent Musk a letter questioning why Tesla was rolling out its \"Full Self Driving\" software even though the company has not officially responded to the NTSB's questions about the automated driving system's safety.\n\n\"It (the Hertz order) puts an exclamation point under guidance for 50%+ growth in deliveries,\" Roth Capital analyst Craig Irwin said. \"Another solid piece of evidence EVs are going mainstream.\"\n\n[1/4]The logo of car manufacturer Tesla is seen at a dealership in London, Britain, May 14, 2021. REUTERS/Matthew Childs/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nTesla now faces the daunting day-to-day challenge of becoming a high-volume automaker growing at a rate not seen since the early 1900s when demand exploded for Henry Ford's Model T.\n\nTesla is coping with an order backlog for its vehicles and extended supply chain disruptions. Tesla Chief Financial Officer Zachary Kirkhorn cautioned investors during a call last week that Tesla's near-term production goals will hinge on resolving those disruptions and ramping up two new, huge assembly and battery plants in Austin and Berlin.\n\n\"There is quite an execution journey ahead of us,\" Kirkhorn said.\n\nRivals are not sitting still. Daimler AG's (DAIGn.DE) Mercedes-Benz brand, General Motors Co (GM.N), Ford Motor Co (F.N), and startups such as Lucid (LCID.O) and China's Xpeng (9868.HK) are all battling Tesla with new electric cars or trucks.\n\nInvestors and analysts, for now, are looking past the near-term challenges. Morgan Stanley boosted its Tesla price target by 33% to $1,200 as the brokerage expects the electric carmaker to surpass 8 million deliveries in 2030.\n\nThe Hertz deal also underscored the power of the Tesla brand, as the rental car company emerges from bankruptcy and aims to revive its once-dominant brand. Hertz's rescue is led by a group of investors including Knighthead Capital Management, Certares Opportunities and Apollo Capital Management.\n\n\"We absolutely believe that this is going to be competitive advantage for us,\" interim Hertz CEO Mark Fields said of the Tesla order, due to be delivered by the end of 2022.\n\n\"We want to be a leader in mobility. ... Getting customers experience with electrified vehicles is an absolute priority for us.\"\n\nTesla's cheapest Model 3 sedan starts at about $44,000, making this order worth about $4.4 billion, if the entire order were for its mass-market sedan.\n\nFields declined to say how much Hertz was paying for the order. Tesla was not immediately available for comment.\n\nWith the current order, Hertz said EVs will make up more than 20% of its global fleet. Fields cited the rising number of EVs for sale and consumer interest in electrified vehicles.\n\nHertz also said it was installing thousands of chargers throughout its network. Customers who rent a Tesla Model 3 will have access to 3,000 Tesla supercharging stations throughout the United States and Europe.\n\nTesla shares closed up 12.7% at $1,024.86.\n\nReporting by Subrat Patnaik and Sanjana Shivdas in Bengaluru and David Shepardson in Washington; Additonal reporting by Eva Mathews, Aniruddha Ghosh and Kannaki Deka; Editing by Joseph White, Shounak Dasgupta, Lisa Shumaker and Richard Chang\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

        "text": "SHANGHAI, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Tesla (TSLA.O) has cut starter prices for its Model 3 and Model Y cars by as much as 9% in China, reversing a trend of increases across the industry amid signs of softening demand in the world's largest auto market.\n\nThe price cuts, posted in listings on the electric vehicle (EV) giant's China website on Monday, are the first by Tesla in China in 2022, and come after Tesla began offering limited incentives to buyers who opted for its insurance last month.\n\nShares of the Austin, Texas-based firm were down 4.9% at $203.9 in early trade.\n\nThe price cuts also follows Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk's comment last week that \"a recession of sorts\" was under way in China and Europe, and Tesla said it would miss its vehicle delivery target this year.\n\nMusk told analysts last week that demand was strong in the current quarter and that he expected Tesla to be \"recession-resilient\".\n\nChina Merchants Bank International (CMBI) said Tesla's price cuts underlined the growing competitive risk for EV makers in China, with industry-wide sales projected to slow into 2023.\n\n\"The price cuts underscore the possible price war which we have been emphasising since August,\" said Shi Ji, an analyst with CMBI.\n\nTesla had cut prices in China last year in an effort to be more competitive in the country, while in the United States, its largest market, the EV maker has raised prices over the past year on higher cost of raw materials.\n\nVisitors wearing face masks check a China-made Tesla Model Y sport utility vehicle (SUV) at the electric vehicle maker's showroom in Beijing, China January 5, 2021. REUTERS/Tingshu Wang/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nData on Monday showed retail sales in China grew 2.5% in September, below the expected 3.3% rise and less than half of August's 5.4% growth.\n\nThe U.S. automaker and several Chinese rivals have hiked prices several times since last year amid rising raw material costs. But Tesla has regularly adjusted prices of its cars in China, including reductions, reflecting government subsidies.\n\nTesla is now China's third best-selling EV maker after BYD Motor (002594.SZ) and SAIC-GM-Wuling (GM.N)(600104.SS), and is the only foreign player in the top 15 list published by the China Passenger Car Association.\n\n\"The price cut is primarily due to overall soft auto demand in China due to macro condition and competition with leading local player BYD,\" U.S. Tiger Securities analyst Bo Pei said.\n\nPei said XPeng , Nio Inc and Li Auto will have to follow or face greater pressure on volumes.\n\nTesla told Reuters it was adjusting prices in line with costs. Capacity utilisation at its Shanghai Gigafactory has improved, while the supply chain remains stable despite the impact on the economy of China's stringent zero-COVID restrictions, leading to lower costs, it said.\n\nThe starting price for the Model 3 sedan was reduced to 265,900 yuan ($36,727) from 279,900 yuan, while that for the Model Y sport utility vehicle was cut to 288,900 yuan from 316,900 yuan, the product prices listed on its Chinese website showed.\n\nTesla upgraded its Shanghai factory earlier this year, after which it delivered 83,135 China-made EVs in September, setting an output record for the plant since production began in December 2019. read more\n\n($1 = 7.2399 Chinese yuan)\n\nReporting by Zhang Yang and Brenda Goh in Beijing and Akash Sriram in Bengaluru; Editing by Kenneth Maxwell and Arun Koyyur\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

It will make a real difference!\" he said in the email.\n\nAnalysts expect Tesla to deliver 442,452 vehicles in the fourth quarter, according to Refinitiv data.\n\nTesla's plummeting share price has hurt the value of shares owned by the EV maker's employees. Tesla has offered stock compensation for most employees including factory workers.\n\nThe company's shares rebounded on Wednesday, following an 11% slump in the previous session on a Reuters report that the automaker planned to run a reduced production schedule in January at its Shanghai plant. The news sparked worries of a drop in demand in the world's biggest car market.\n\n\"Btw, don't be too bothered by stock market craziness. As we demonstrate continued excellent performance, the market will recognize that,\" he said.\n\n\"Long-term, I believe very much that Tesla will be the most valuable company on Earth!\"\n\nMorgan Stanley analysts cut their price target on the stock to $250 from $330, saying the last two years of demand exceeding supply will be \"substantially inverted to supply exceeding demand\" in 2023.\n\nReporting by Hyunjoo Jin in San Francisco and Akash Sriram in Bengaluru; Editing by Matthew Lewis and Anil D'Silva\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
