    "text": "Netflix (NFLX) reported its Q1 earnings after the closing bell on Tuesday, adding 15.7 million global users amid stay-at-home orders related to the novel coronavirus pandemic \u2014 a 23% jump since the same quarter last year.\n\nThe company\u2019s stock was still down nearly 3% in early trading on Wednesday.\n\nHere\u2019s how the company performed in the quarter, and how many more people are using the service during the lockdowns.\n\nGlobal streaming net paid subscriber additions: 15.77 million vs. 7 million forecasted\n\nRevenue: $5.7 billion vs. $5.7 billion expected\n\nEarnings per share: $1.57 vs. $1.64 expected\n\nNetflix was one of the few companies not to pull its earnings guidance following the coronavirus outbreak, and the resulting collapse in global economic activity stemming from widespread lockdown orders.\n\nThe reason? With people stuck in their homes \u2014 unable to participate in any form of outdoor entertainment \u2014 consumers are turning to streaming video platforms like Netflix to stave off boredom and, in households with homebound children, keep their kids entertained.\n\n02 April 2020, Berlin: A young man watches series at the provider \"Netflix\". To prevent infection with the corona virus, many people spend their free time at home.

According to the company, the impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar versus other foreign currencies, and a $218 million charge for pausing productions, along with a hardship fund commitment, put a dent in the service\u2019s bottom line.\n\nWill new subscribers stick around?\n\nWhile Netflix may have added millions of subscribers in Q1, the question remains: What happens when we are able to go outside again? Will the company be able to hold on to those new subscribers, or will they simply ditch the service once other entertainment options are available again?\n\nAccording to Bank of America analyst Nat Schindler, the new users are likely to become permanent subscribers to the service.\n\n\u201cWe anticipate the step-up will result in a permanent increase in penetration for Netflix's subscriber model and see its low price-point and staple nature supporting healthy fundamentals performance in a recession, even after stay-home orders are lifted,\u201d he said, before the earnings announcement.\n\nStory continues\n\nNetflix subscriptions start at $8.99 per month, giving you the ability to stream to one TV at standard definition. A standard plan costs $12.99 and gets you the ability to stream to two televisions at HD resolutions. A $15.99 premium plan lets you stream to four TVs at once in 4K resolutions.\n\nDisney+, meanwhile, costs $6.99 per month, while Amazon\u2019s Prime video costs $8.99 per month, but is free with a $120 yearly Prime subscription.\n\nNetflix, however, is going to have to contend with a period in the near future when it doesn\u2019t have any new shows. That\u2019s because TV and movie production around the world has more or less stalled. As a result, companies like Netflix may not have any new shows in the later half of the year.\n\nBut that isn\u2019t going to be any different for the company\u2019s biggest competitors.\n\nMore from Dan:\n\nGot a tip?

    "title": "Breakingviews - Netflix is still the pointiest FAANG",

    "text": "The Netflix logo is seen on their office in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, U.S. July 16, 2018. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - For Netflix investors, reality bites. Netflix\u2019s subscriber growth is slowing, and boss Reed Hastings has decided to share his chief executive role. That was enough to knock around 10% off the streaming service\u2019s stock in after-hours trading on Thursday. But even after a 60% share price rise this year, well ahead of Facebook, Alphabet and Apple, Netflix is still the sharpest FAANG.\n\nThe $230 billion firm added more than 10 million subscribers during the second quarter, compared with analyst estimates of 8 million, according to Refinitiv. The problem is that momentum is flagging as people emerge from lockdowns. Netflix reckons it will hook just under 3 million more net subscribers by the end of September. That made Thursday a poor time to announce the elevation of Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos to the clunky position of co-CEO. What\u2019s arguably sensible succession planning \u2013 Sarandos is one of the most powerful producers in Hollywood \u2013 can also look from the outside like a founder getting ready to follow other pursuits.\n\nStill, it\u2019s mainly a story of high expectations. Netflix\u2019s stock this year has surpassed other high-flying tech kin Facebook, Apple and Alphabet, whose search engine Google gives the FAANGs their \u201cG\u201d. Only Amazon.com, which has proved an essential service during the pandemic, rivals Netflix\u2019s rise. And some correction may be healthy. The company trades at 67 times estimated earnings for the next 12 months. If Covid-19 hadn\u2019t virtually stopped production, Netflix would have burned cash this quarter, and for at least the next year.\n\nTrue, customers have expanding choice, which makes it harder to garner new eyeballs. Sport franchises are preparing to get back into action. The U.S. National Basketball Association and Major League Baseball intend to air games soon. And rival services are finally getting off the ground. Comcast launched its streaming service Peacock on Wednesday. AT&T unveiled HBO Max in May. Unlike other FAANGs, Netflix hasn\u2019t aroused the ire of antitrust watchdogs, but that\u2019s because it lacks their obvious dominance.\n\nEven so, Hastings\u2019 firm has gained ground that it\u2019s unlikely to give up. A looming recession, or slow recovery, could lead consumers to cut back on spending, but it\u2019s not Netflix that will lose from that. A survey conducted for MoffettNathanson found that tight finances are the top reason people ditch pay-TV \u2013 and pick up streaming services like Netflix. Hastings\u2019 creation still hasn\u2019t lost its bite."

    "text": "Stuck at home during the Covid-19 pandemic, Americans have been streaming movies and TV with abandon. They\u2019ve plowed through Tiger King and the much-acclaimed production of Hamilton. Millions have even made time for game shows as low-brow as Floor is Lava (pretty much what it sounds like), which turned into a hit for Netflix Inc. At the peak in late March and early April, people in the U.S. were devouring in excess of 160 billion minutes of streaming video per week\u2014the equivalent of about 8 hours per person, or twice what they had a year prior, when a trip to the cineplex didn\u2019t run much risk of contracting a deadly virus.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Blackstone Group Inc. decided to buy a 49% stake in three Hollywood studio lots. Hard times have always been a boon for escapist entertainment, but the Blackstone deal, which the company said was completed Aug. 3 and valued the properties at $1.65 billion, was a long-term bet on streaming. Even after the pandemic, companies such as Netflix, Amazon.com Inc., and Walt Disney Co. will need stages to feed the world\u2019s bottomless appetite for video."

    "text": "Netflix (NFLX) has thrived amid the novel coronavirus, which forced billions of people across the globe into their homes and helped the streaming service add almost as many subscribers in the first six months of 2020 as it did all of last year.\n\nBut the company rose from DVD-by-mail startup to streaming giant well before the pandemic, upending the movie and television industries as competitors launched their own versions of its online service.\n\nNetflix co-CEO and co-founder Reed Hastings speaks with Yahoo Finance's Andy Serwer.\n\nIn a recent interview, Netflix co-founder and co-CEO Reed Hastings told Yahoo Finance how the company\u2019s unorthodox management style drove it to innovate and grow \u2014 a process that he and co-author Erin Meyer detail in a new book \u201cNo Rules Rules: Netflix and the Culture of Reinvention.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe really manage right on the edge of chaos,\u201d Hastings says. \u201cIt's not the most efficient place, but that's part of why we've been able to adapt.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you think of the last 300 years, we've had factories providing enormous economic value, and so a lot of our society has the factory as the model of the organization,\u201d he adds. \u201cVery top down, very process, very efficient.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it's not the right way to run a creative organization,\u201d he adds. \u201cAn organization that needs new ideas; [that] needs to be able to make mistakes.\u201d\n\nThe company \u2014 which as of May employs 8,600 people \u2014 provides workers with unlimited vacation days, pays high compensation but does not use bonuses, and encourages employees to give each other direct, honest feedback.\n\n\u201cWe've been able to adapt from DVD by mail to domestic streaming to global streaming to original content in less than 20 years,\u201d Hastings says. \u201cBecause we're so focused on supporting creativity.\u201d\n\nROME, ITALY - OCTOBER 08: Reed Hastings attends the Netflix & Mediaset Partnership Announcement, Rome, 8th October 2019. (Photo by Ernesto S. Ruscio/Getty Images / Netflix)\n\nNetflix has drawn attention and some criticism for what the company calls the \u201ckeeper test,\u201d which asks managers to assess direct-reports based on whether they would try to prevent them from leaving for another company. A report from the Wall Street Journal, in 2018, found that the approach contributed to anxiety among workers who fear a sudden dismissal.\n\nStory continues\n\nHastings rejected the notion of unhappiness among Netflix employees, citing employee satisfaction surveys that rank Netflix among the top companies nationwide.\n\n\u201cNetflix employees love working there,\u201d Hastings says. \u201cIt's so fun because people feel the trust, the openness of the culture, information sharing, and because they've got incredible colleagues \u2014 and so they get to do a lot.\u201d\n\nBut the workplace culture at Netflix fits a certain type of employee, Hastings acknowledged.\n\n\u201cNetflix is not for everyone,\u201d he says. \u201cNetflix is for people who are learning machines. They just love absorbing new ideas and new experiences and are willing to make mistakes to figure things out. And it's those kind of self-motivated learners that do so well at Netflix.\u201d\n\nHastings spoke to Yahoo Finance Editor-in-Chief Andy Serwer in an episode of \u201cInfluencers with Andy Serwer,\u201d a weekly interview series with leaders in business, politics, and entertainment. The complete interview will air on Sept. 10.\n\nNetflix co-founder and co-CEO Reed Hastings and co-author Erin Meyer detail the company's unorthodox management style in the new book \"No Rules Rules: Netflix and the Culture of Reinvention.\"\n\nThe streaming service added nearly 26 million subscribers over the first six months of this year, bringing its total subscribers worldwide to about 193 million. By comparison, Disney Plus (DIS) had 60.5 million subscribers worldwide as of Aug. 3 \u2014 though the platform has operated for a far shorter time, having launched last November.\n\nOver the past year, Netflix has faced a slew of new competitors in streaming, including Disney Plus HBO Max (T), Peacock (CMCSA), and Apple TV (AAPL). Plus, Hulu and Amazon Prime (AMZN) remain significant challengers.\n\nNevertheless, 41% of Netflix users plan to keep their subscriptions after the pandemic \u2014 a higher retention rate than any other service, according to a survey of 1,000 Americans released by Piper Sandler on Aug. 25.\n\nThe management tactic perhaps most affiliated with Netflix is its unlimited vacation time for employees, which gives them immense flexibility but also may deter some workers from taking sufficient time off due to a lack of clarity about how much is appropriate.\n\nHastings said the company doesn\u2019t track employee vacation time but that he models an opportunistic approach to the benefit.\n\n\u201cI try to set a great example by taking a lot of vacation,\u201d he says. \u201cI'm always talking about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of the time you come up with your greatest ideas when you're on vacation,\u201d he adds.\n\nRead more:"

    "title": "How Netflix\u2019s overseas expansion fueled its explosive growth in subscribers",
    "publish_date": "01/20/2021",
    "text": "Netflix (NFLX) reported its Q4 2020 earnings after the closing bell on Tuesday, blowing away analysts\u2019 expectations by adding 8.51 million new subscribers in the quarter. And the driving force behind that expansion was Netflix\u2019s international markets.\n\nThe company added 7.7 million new users outside of the U.S. and Canada in the quarter, with a whopping 4.46 million coming from the company\u2019s Europe, Middle East, and Africa, or EMEA, region.\n\nAnd, as Yahoo Finance\u2019s Brian Sozzi points out, the company\u2019s stock has skyrocketed as a result of those new subscribers. At the close of markets on Wednesday the stock was up 16.85%, closing at $586.34. This spike came despite the earnings per share for the quarter coming in $0.17 shy of expectations.\n\nAnd it\u2019s those international markets, and the content that appeals to those consumers, that analysts say will continue to push Netflix forward in the future. Shows like Germany\u2019s \u201cBarbarians\u201d and South Korea\u2019s \u201cSweet Home,\u201d are driving consumers to Netflix, and even translating to hits in the U.S. The French series \u201cLupin\u201d recently cracked Netflix\u2019s Top 10 most popular shows in the U.S., topping out in the number two slot.\n\n\u201cWe view Netflix\u2019s original, local content as one of the key differentiators and competitive advantages, especially given the discount of international content vs. domestic content,\u201d UBS Global Research\u2019s Eric Sheridan wrote in a research note following Netflix\u2019s earnings report.\n\nNetflix\u2019s international growth was off the charts\n\nIt makes sense that Netflix\u2019s international growth was so much better than the company\u2019s U.S. and Canada (UCAN) expansion. UCAN is a relatively mature market for Netflix compared to its international regions. But that doesn\u2019t take away from how impressive those numbers were.\n\n\u201cNetflix continues to push for global subs with competition intensifying, but we believe the streaming landscape can support multiple players, with Netflix the industry leader,\u201d Piper Sandler\u2019s Yung Kim wrote in a research note.\n\nStory continues\n\nFILE - This March 20, 2012, file photo, shows Netfilx headquarters in Los Gatos, Calif. Netflix confirmed Wednesday, Dec. 9, 2015, that it is upgrading the parental leave policies covering hundreds of hourly workers in its DVD-by-mail division after being skewered for giving more generous baby benefits to the better-paid engineers and other employees in its more popular Internet video service. (AP Photo/Paul Sakuma, File)\n\nOf course, competition is heating up for Netflix both domestically and internationally. And its surefire way of fighting back is its local content. That, the company said in its Q4 report, has proven especially helpful in drawing subscribers and keeping them hooked.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, those same shows, according to Netflix, are surprisingly successful outside of their local markets, as well.\n\nIn other words, Netflix\u2019s international expansion strategy isn\u2019t just helping it build out its audience in new markets \u2014 it\u2019s also helping keep viewers interested in established ones.\n\nMargins could expand as Netflix raises prices internationally\n\nNetflix has proven that its formula of original and third-party content is a winner, so much so that competitors are copying it at every turn, pushing into similar international regions and offering both new original and old, fan favorite movies and shows. But the best signal that Netflix continues to deliver for consumers is that it\u2019s able to raise prices without losing those same customers.\n\nNetflix increased its price for its Standard plan in the U.S. from $13 to $14 and while its Premium tier increased from $16 to $18 as of October. Despite that, the company still beat expectations.\n\nKim says Netflix even still has room to grow with further price increases. In fact, Kim writes, a recent survey his firm conducted of 600 U.S. Netflix subscribers found that respondents were willing to pay an average of $2.20 more per to keep streaming the service.\n\nOf course, once pandemic lockdowns ease up, Netflix will likely see its rate of new subscribers slow down. Its subscribers for 2021 could pale in comparison to the last quarter of 2020.\n\nBut Netflix is still clearly the market leader with 200 million global subscribers, easily surpassing rivals including Amazon Prime Video, which has an estimated 26 million subscribers. And if its international expansion continues, that won\u2019t change anytime soon.\n\nSign up for Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter\n\nYahoo Finance Tech\n\nGot a tip?

REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nJan 19 (Reuters) - Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) said on Tuesday its global subscriber rolls crossed 200 million at the end of 2020 and projected it will no longer need to borrow billions of dollars to finance its broad slate of TV shows and movies.\n\nShares of Netflix rose nearly 13% in extended trading as the financial milestone validated the company's strategy of going into debt to take on big Hollywood studios with a flood of its own programming in multiple languages.\n\nThe world's largest streaming service had raised $15 billion through debt in less than a decade. On Tuesday, the company said it expected free cash flow to break even in 2021, adding in a letter to shareholders, \"We believe we no longer have a need to raise external financing for our day-to-day operations.\"\n\nNetflix said it will explore returning excess cash to shareholders via share buybacks. It plans to maintain $10 billion to $15 billion in gross debt.\n\n\"This is in sharp contrast to Disney and many other new entrants into the streaming market who expect to lose money on streaming for the next few years,\" said eMarketer analyst Eric Haggstrom.\n\nFrom October to December, Netflix signed up 8.5 million new paying streaming customers as it debuted widely praised series \"The Queen's Gambit\" and \"Bridgerton,\" a new season of \"The Crown\" and the George Clooney film \"The Midnight Sky.\"\n\nThe additions topped Wall Street estimates of 6.1 million, according to Refinitiv data, despite increased competition and a U.S. price increase. Fourth-quarter earnings per share of $1.19 missed analyst expectations of $1.39.\n\nWith the new customers, Netflix's worldwide membership reached 203.7 million. The company that pioneered streaming in 2007 added more subscribers in 2020 than in any other year, boosted by viewers who stayed home to fight the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nCOMPETITION HEATS UP\n\nNow, Netflix is working to add customers around the globe as big media companies amp up competition. Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) in December unveiled a hefty slate of new programming for Disney+, while AT&T Inc's (T.N) Warner Bros scrapped the traditional Hollywood playbook by announcing it would send all 2021 movies straight to HBO Max alongside theaters.\n\nDisney said in December it had already signed up 86.8 million subscribers to Disney+ in just over a year.\n\n\"It's super-impressive what Disney's done,\" Netflix Co-Chief Executive Reed Hastings said in a post-earnings analyst interview. Disney's success, he added, \"gets us fired up about increasing our membership, increasing our content budget.\"\n\nNetflix said most of its growth last year - 83% of new customers - came from outside the United States and Canada. Forty-one percent joined from Europe, the Middle East and Africa.\n\nFor January through March, Netflix projected it would sign up 6 million more global subscribers, behind analyst expectations of roughly 8 million.\n\nRevenue for the fourth quarter rose to $6.64 billion compared with $5.47 billion a year ago, edging past estimates of $6.63 billion.\n\nNet income fell to $542.2 million, or $1.19 per share, from $587 million, or $1.30 per share, a year earlier.\n\nNetflix shares jumped 12.5% to $564.32 in extended trading on Tuesday.\n\nReporting by Eva Mathews in Bengaluru and Lisa Richwine in Los Angeles; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Click the expected move links to see more historical detail.\n\nTuesday before the open\n\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS) 3.9%\n\nBank of America Corp (NYSE: BAC) 3.8%\n\nTuesday after the close\n\nNetflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX) 6.7%\n\nUnitedHealth Group Inc (NYSE: UNH) 3.3%\n\nMorgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) 3.8%\n\nProcter & Gamble Co (NYSE: PG) 2.7%\n\nWednesday before the open\n\nUnited Airlines Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: UAL) 5.2%\n\nThursday after the close\n\nIntel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) 5.3%\n\nIBM (NYSE: IBM) 4.2%\n\nNetflix: Using the Expected Move to Help Inform Spread Trading\n\nWith option traders currently pricing a move in NFLX of approx. 6.7% up or down on earnings, the following chart from Options AI can help visualize potential trading opportunities and form a basis for more informed strike selection when using options. Here's how:\n\nAt the time of writing, with NFLX just below $500 and the expected move implying a bullish consensus around $530 and a bearish consensus near $463, an initial decision point might be whether option traders have got this right.\n\nSource: Options AI\n\nStarting with the view that the options market is overestimating the move in either direction, let's first look at \u2018selling the move' to both the bulls and bears, with the expected move guiding strike selection.\n\nNetflix \u2013 Using the Move for Income Generating Strategies\n\nWhen \u2018selling the move', Premium (or income) received from selling options is kept if the stock stays within a specific range. Here's a look at an Iron Condor and Iron Butterfly for this week's expiration. Both trades sell both a call spread and a put spread. The key difference is that with overlapping short strikes, the Iron Fly targets a very specific price target for achieving max gain:\n\nStory continues\n\nSource: Options AI\n\nSource: Options AI\n\nIn this example, the +460p/-497.5p/-497.5c/+535c Iron Butterfly targets a stock price of $497.50. At expiry, max. profit will be realized at this price level and profits decline the further the stock moves from that point. So, the Iron Fly is a strategy that a trader might use if highly convicted on their price view. On this chart you can see the two breakevens, just inside the expected move:\n\nSource: Options AI\n\nThe Iron Condor is less precise, and establishes a range within which reward is the same. In this example the +460p/-465p/-532.5c/+537.5c Iron Condor results in max. gain at expiry if the stock stays anywhere between $465 and $532.50. A move outside of that range, beyond the long strikes, means max. loss.\n\nBoth an Iron Condor and Iron Butterfly have the benefit of being defined risk spread strategies. So, when selling a move, choosing between the two may come down to conviction level and willingness to trade potential reward for higher probability. While by no means the only basis for strike selection, on Options AI, both strategies can be generated in a couple of clicks, allowing for straightforward comparison.\n\nView more earnings on GS\n\nSource: Options AI\n\nNetflix \u2013 Using the Move for Bullish Strategies\n\nWith a bullish view, a trader can consider and compare a few spread trades, again using expected move strikes. With a debit spread, a call is bought, but then a spread might be created by selling a call at the expected move. A Debit Call Spread creates a range of profitability between the trade's breakeven and its short call. It lessens the cost of the long call (and therefore increases the probability of profit by lowering the breakeven). In many cases a call spread to the expected move will have a similar price to an out of the money call, yet with a greater probability of profit.\n\n\n\nSource: Options AI\n\nAlso available to a bullish trader is a credit spread. The trade comparison below shows two different potential credit put spreads. One at-the-money and the other out-the-money. Both are essentially \u2018selling to the bears'.\n\n\n\nSource: Options AI\n\nNote that a far out-the-money Credit Put Spread (the last trade shown) has the highest Probability of Profit (likelihood of the stock expiring higher than the breakeven level) but it also presents a relatively high risk to reward ratio (nearly 4 to 1). It can be thought of as selling to those that are extremely bearish.\n\nBelow is the out-the-money Bullish Credit Put Spread on the expected move chart. As you can see, there is relatively high probability of max. gain, but when it is not, it is costly compared to the reward:\n\n\n\nSource: Options AI\n\nWhether a trader chooses a debit or a credit spread might depend on their own level of bullishness, compared to the crowd.\n\nNetflix \u2013 Using the Move for Bearish Strategies\n\nThe same concepts apply to spreads with a bearish view. Here's an example using the 6.7% expected move in Netflix, generating a Debit Put Spread, but also Credit Call Spreads:\n\n\n\nSource: Options AI\n\nAnd the trades can be charted, showing their profit/loss at expiration based on different stock prices. This can help highlight some differences between the debit and credit spreads:\n\n\n\nSource: Options AI\n\nSummary\n\nThe expected move can provide actionable insight to consider before making any trade, particularly into an uncertain event. Whether gut-checking your own expectations versus the options crowd, generating trade ideas from option market signals, or for more informed strike selection. That's why Options AI puts the expected move at the heart of its chart-based platform. Learn / Options AI has a couple of free tools as well as education on expected moves and spread trading. The concepts shown in Netflix can apply to any stock and it is simply used here for illustrative purposes.\n\nThe post The Week Ahead in Options and Using the Expected Move to Spread Trade Netflix. appeared first on Options AI: Learn.\n\nPhoto by Mollie Sivaram on Unsplash\n\nSee more from Benzinga\n\n\u00a9 2021 Benzinga.com.

The company cited increased competition and the strong U.S. dollar among the reasons for the so-so report.\n\nNetflix added 8.28 million global paid net subscribers in the last quarter of 2021, beating the 8.13 forecasted by analysts, according to Bloomberg data. But it's outlook wasn't too inspiring.\n\nThe company said it expects to add 2.5 million subscribers in the first quarter, compared to 3.98 million during the first quarter last year.\n\nMorgan Stanley, KeyBank and Barclays all downgraded Netflix shares on Friday.\n\nBut Pivotal's Wlodarczak is staying hopeful on Netflix longer-term even as he thinks the stock may go nowhere in the near-term.\n\n\"In the end we think the Netflix flywheel is still working it is just operating at a slower pace given the massive pull forward of demand enabled by pandemic shutdowns and over time we expect normalization in subscriber results and for the stock to work,\" Wlodarczak added.\n\nThe analyst reiterated a Buy rating on Netflix but slashed his price target to $550 from $750.\n\nYahoo Finance's Alexandra Semanova contributed to this story.\n\nBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

    "text": "\"Alpharetta, GA, USA - September 29, 2012 - Amazon.com's Kindle fire with Netflix's streamable movie page loaded on the tablet.\"\n\nThe global film industry is about to face a wave of disruption from cryptocurrency start-ups that harness the power of blockchain.\n\nThe tremors of change were felt when the Netflix (NFLX) share price plummeted by over 20% after a sharp downturn in its subscriber uptake. Veteran production companies such as Disney+ (DIS) and Warner Media\u2019s HBO Max are making significant inroads and retaking lost ground in an ongoing streaming war with Web 2.0 disruptors such as Amazon Prime Video (AMZN), Apple TV (AAPL) and Netflix.\n\nHowever, the battleground for industry market share may have already shifted to a new front \u2014 the \"wild-west\" of cryptocurrencies and decentralised film, or DeFilm.\n\nThe advent of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), blockchain solutions and cryptocurrency transactions threaten to dismantle the traditional structures of the art world, global finance and the music industry. Now the winds of change have turned towards the bastions of the film industry and many analysts forecast that blockchain will shape the future of how films are produced, distributed and exhibited.\n\nPRODUCTION\n\nCrypto start-ups, such as Moviecoin.com, have ambitions to disrupt Hollywood by offering the chance for anyone to invest in film production and take a share of the profits via the blockchain.\n\nThe start-up was created as a response to the concentration of film industry power into fewer and fewer hands. Moviecoin\u2019s long term goal is to break the power of the monopolies through decentralising and democratising the world of movie finance.\n\nRead more: Can you live in London for 24hrs using only bitcoin?\n\nThe big tech monopolies that emerged at the beginning of the Web 2.0 internet development stage have moved from streaming content to content production, with the advent of Amazon Prime Video and Netflix originals. This narrows the variety of films that get produced and emphasises the pursuit of profit at the expense of quality and creativity, according to Moviecoin.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoviecoin said it offers the opportunity for anyone to be a film financier and invest as little as they like through smart contracts deployed on the blockchain.\n\nThese transactions using the Moviecoin cryptocurrency (MOVIE) will remain transparent on the Ethereum (ETH-USD) blockchain, a public ledger where transactions are automatically executed without the need for human intermediaries.\n\nA share of a film\u2019s profit that is financed in this revolutionary new way can also be accessed by purchasing presale NFTs associated with the films. The Moviecoin.com platform already boasts productions starring Russell Crowe, Ray Winstone and Mel Gibson.\n\nNetflix's share price plummeted by over 20% after a sharp downturn in its subscriber uptake. Chart: Yahoo Finance UK\n\nMoviecoin's team leaders James Mackie and James Hickey told Yahoo Finance the new mode of film financing \u201cwill be a wake-up call for those few with the power to control the narrative of movies via production funding\u201d.\n\nUpcoming biographical movie Prizefighter starring Russell Crowe and Ray Winstone is one of the films being part-financed through the Moviecoin cryptocurrency and NFT pre-sales on the start-up's platform. Moviecoin.com currently have the rights to make NFTs of the props from the film.\n\nWriter and lead actor Matt Hookings told Yahoo Finance UK that it is \u201cgetting harder and harder for indie filmmakers to get a film made and seen\u201d.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin: 2021 in 12 charts\n\nHe said that a decentralised film-making process \u201callows a new system that disrupts the status quo and gives more people a chance to make films that need to be seen by audiences\".\n\n\"We need to flush out the middlemen who don't add value to the industry, but are still taking their piece of the profit.\u201d\n\nIn the current film industry, \u201cthe middle ground does not exist\u201d, Hookings said \u2014 with either big-budget monoculture productions with the same A-list talent or low budget indie features that no one ever sees because sales agents are so risk-averse.\n\nMark O\u2019Connor, director of the award-winning Irish crime drama Cardboard Gangsters is also using the Moviecoin platform for crypto production financing.\n\nO\u2019Connor told Yahoo Finance UK that \u201ccrypto-communities have a power that is unprecedented, and if you get that passion supporting a film project, especially when they are incentivised because they have invested with the Moviecoin cryptocurrency, a lot of finance can be raised, and a ready-made audience is there for the film\u201d.\n\nWatch: What is bitcoin?\n\nDISTRIBUTION\n\nGetting an independent film seen by audiences is difficult, especially when big streaming sites are now mostly focused on original programming.\n\nThe process involves persuading a sales agent to sell a film\u2019s licensing rights to distributors. These distributors then decide where and when the film gets exhibited in cinemas and on DVDs and television.\n\nThese days, the most lucrative deals are with the streaming giants, such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV and Disney+. The trade is often relationship-based and both agents and buyers are risk-averse and it is extremely difficult to get them to select a film that isn\u2019t led by an A-list star.\n\nBrian Rose, founder of London Real YouTube Channel told Yahoo Finance UK about the struggle of indie filmmakers attempting to attract the attention of streaming giants. He said he pitched the feature-length documentaries he has produced, which include interviews with Jordan Petersen, David Goggins and Dennis McKenna, to Netflix gatekeepers \"but unless it was produced by them or consistent with their branded material, they were not interested\u201d.\n\nHe described the difficulties of negotiation with \u201cthird party agents, and if Netflix does pay you, you get paid over 36 months, but you are never shown any metrics of how many views your film has received, the Netflix audience metrics have never been transparent to the public.\u201d\n\nNetflix does not reveal how much they pay to host films on their platform, they also do not reveal the percentage producers receive from the films that they stream.\n\nHowever, in a Web 3.0 blockchain-based distribution system data that was once private will be available to film financiers, so they can get an accurate picture of which films are doing well, and those that are unprofitable.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin: Top 10 'buy the dip' investors\n\nThis is important as the film industry is notorious for its creative accounting that can make a movie appear unprofitable, meaning that sometimes creatives involved in a film\u2019s production allegedly do not receive their agreed profit share.\n\nHickey said that the transparency of the blockchain will allow audiences to also be investors and see \u201cwhere investment goes and how the chain of distribution actually works which will lead them to comparisons with major streaming sites and ask why the writer of the film makes very little money\u201d.\n\nHe said that in the current streaming model \u201cthose that make movies get a terrible deal, it's borderline robbery of their hard work and years of experience, once the finished product is presented.\u201d\n\nYahoo Finance UK asked Netflix for their stance on the rise of blockchain distribution and cryptocurrency financing, but the company said they \u201cdon't have a comment to make about this story\u201d.\n\nIn a decentralised film industry, digital rights management and royalties could be transparently tracked through the deployment of smart contracts. The smart contract takes the agreement terms of an actual paper contract and allows revenue streams to flow automatically from external sources such as audiences who purchase or rent a film to the intellectual property owners, such as the producers and screenwriters.\n\nMoviecoin\u2019s Mackie and Hickey said: \u201cSmart contracts built into NFTs and MOVIE coin will ensure the rights are forever cemented on-chain, the record will always be there, the contract will ensure the owners of the IP receive the correct amounts.\u201d\n\nNetflix's share price plummeted by over 20% after a sharp downturn in its subscriber uptake. Photo: Dado Ruvic/Reuters\n\nAnother problem with video sharing and distribution platforms is de-platforming and content removal. When content is centralised on servers controlled by privately owned corporations, they have the power over which content is removed and which is promoted.\n\nBecause they are private corporations, there is no independent ombudsman to referee de-platforming disputes.\n\nYouTube and Facebook (FB) are considered \u201cprivate spaces\u201d under US law, meaning freedom of speech within these spaces is not guaranteed by the state. A new precedent was set in US law in February 2020 that officially recognised YouTube as not being a \"public forum\", and so it did not need to ensure users' rights to free speech.\n\nMedia academics Sonia Livingstone and Peter Lunt said that protecting citizens from harmful and offensive material through regulation and moderation comes at the expense of creativity, freedom of expression and the rights of consumers to view whatever they want, whenever they want.\n\nRose said he thought his production company \"would be de-platformed because of a controversial documentary led to a YouTube prohibited content warning and even a Dropbox ban\". For this reason, London Real \"is thinking of a blockchain-based peer to peer distribution service\".\n\nHickey said that Moviecoin's goal is to also \u201cbuild our own decentralised distribution platform\u201d.\n\nRead more: Cybercriminals laundered $8.6bn worth of crypto in 2021\n\nThriller film Zero Contact starring Anthony Hopkins was reportedly the first feature film to be released via Vuele, a non-fungible token film distribution platform, in 2021. The digital artwork associated with Zero Contract is already listed on Opensea in the lucrative NFT resale market.\n\nSome 18 NFTs associated with the Moviecoin backed film Prizefighter, consist of physical props from the movie alongside their digital NFT counterpart, have also made their way to the Opensea, the largest NFT market in the world. Each Prizefighter NFT purchased represents a 0.016% total profit share of the film. So, if the film makes $50m profit, each NFT holder will automatically receive $8,000 in profit paid via smart contract into their digital wallet in the Moviecoin cryptocurrency.\n\nRaising film finance through presales of NFTs is a brand new way of raising funds. Hickey and Mackie said NFT pre-sales will \u201cremove the intermediaries from the chain, there will be far more money in the pot to give to the creatives, the talented people that actually bring the movies to life!\u201d\n\nThey said money will be more evenly shared between investors, producers and artists, so an actor from a movie would receive 25% gross royalties forever from any NFT sale using their image.\n\nThe disruptive potential of blockchain technology has now reached the movie business. Photo: Getty\n\nEXHIBITION\n\nWeb 3.0, also known as the decentralised web, is the latest generation of internet applications and services, powered by distributed ledger technology, the most common being blockchains. It is focused on prioritising user ownership of personal data and allowing seamless interoperability between distinct blockchain applications in an automatic way that undercuts intermediaries.\n\nA metaverse is a network of 3D virtual worlds where users can socialise and purchase digital goods and services using cryptocurrency transactions.\n\nMoviecoin plans to harness the metaverse to exhibit the content that they produce and distribute. The start-up has already purchased land in Sandbox, which is an Ethereum-based decentralised NFT gaming metaverse. There they plan to build a 24-hour virtual cinema where audiences can \u201ctake part in VR and AR experiences funded on our platform\u201d.\n\nMoviecoin said: \u201cWe are exploring multiple ways for fans to watch movies funded on Moviecoin in the metaverse, we envision galleries and cinemas offering exclusive pay per view content, with almost all revenue going to those that made the movies.\"\n\nSandbox is in contrast to Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Metaverse where all user experience and personal data will be centralised and stored on an AI supercomputer, dubbed AI Research SuperCluster (RSC).\n\nA metaverse is a network of 3D virtual worlds where users can socialise and purchase digital goods and services using cryptocurrency transactions. Photo: Getty\n\nHickey and Mackie of Moviecoin have urged the Web 2.0 streaming services and the traditional studios \u201cto think about giving a better deal to the creatives, whether or not we challenge their position\u201d. However, they surmise that these corporations are \u201cbig players with deep pockets and have large intelligent teams that won't sit still, so for now we will focus on building something that helps as many people as possible get a better deal.\u201d\n\nThe disruptive potential of blockchain technology has now reached the movie business. But, by its very essence of decentralisation and disintermediation, this new technological development is one that studios may not be able to adapt to.\n\nThe \"golden age\" when studio executives dictated what audiences watched and when they watched it could truly become, once upon a time in Hollywood...\n\nWatch: Can you live exclusively off bitcoin?"

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration//File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nLOS ANGELES, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Netflix Inc has raised its monthly subscription price by $1 to $2 per month in the United States depending on the plan, the company said on Friday, to help pay for new programming to compete in the crowded streaming TV market.\n\nThe standard plan, which allows for two simultaneous streams, now costs $15.49 per month, up from $13.99, in the United States.\n\nPrices also rose in Canada, where the standard plan climbed to C$16.49 from C$14.99.\n\nShares of Netflix gained nearly 3% to $533.84 on Nasdaq after Reuters broke the news of the price rises. They closed 1.3% higher at $525.69.\n\nThe increases, the first in those markets since October 2020, took effect immediately for new customers. Existing members will see the new prices in the coming weeks when they receive their monthly bills.\n\n\"We understand people have more entertainment choices than ever and we\u2019re committed to delivering an even better experience for our members,\" a Netflix spokesperson said.\n\n\"We\u2019re updating our prices so that we can continue to offer a wide variety of quality entertainment options. As always we offer a range of plans so members can pick a price that works for their budget,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nThe world's largest streaming service is facing the most competition ever from companies looking to attract viewers to online entertainment. Walt Disney Co (DIS.N), AT&T Inc's (T.N) WarnerMedia, Amazon.com Inc and Apple Inc (AAPL.O) are among the rivals pouring billions into new programming.\n\nNetflix has added customers despite prior price increases, which shows its members have been willing to accept higher costs, Evercore ISI analyst Mark Mahaney said.\n\n\"This is evidence that Netflix has pricing power,\" Mahaney said.\n\nNetflix had said it would spend $17 billion on programming in 2021. The company has not disclosed spending for 2022.\n\nThe U.S. price of Netflix's premium plan, which enables four streams at a time and streaming in ultra HD, was increased by $2 to $19.99 per month. For Netflix's basic plan, with one stream, the cost rose by $1 to $9.99 per month.\n\nIn Canada, the premium plan rose by C$2 to C$20.99, and the basic plan was unchanged at C$9.99.\n\nAt $15.49 per month, the standard U.S. plan from Netflix now costs more than competitors. HBO Max, owned by AT&T Inc (T.N), is currently offering an $11.99-a-month promotion for 12 months.\n\nThe price of Walt Disney Co's (DIS.N) Disney+ is $7.99 a month or $79.99 a year.\n\nThe United States and Canada is Netflix's largest region with 74 million streaming customers as of September 2021. The region accounted for nearly 44% of the company's revenue in 2021's third quarter, or about $3.3 billion.\n\nMost of the company's recent pickup in subscribers has come from overseas.\n\nNetflix's subscriber growth slowed from a boom early in the COVID-19 pandemic but rebounded with help from global phenomenon \"Squid Game,\" a dystopian thriller from South Korea released in September. Total global subscriptions reached 213.6 million.\n\nThe company's next subscriber report is due Thursday when Netflix posts quarterly earnings. Analysts project the company will report 8.5 million new sign-ups from October through December, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S data, bringing its global subscriber base to 222 million.\n\nReporting by Lisa Richwine; Additional reporting by Dawn Chmielewski; Editing by Cynthia Osterman\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

    "text": "LOS ANGELES, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Netflix Inc dashed hopes for a quick rebound after forecasting weak first-quarter subscriber growth on Thursday, sending shares sinking nearly 20% and wiping away most of its remaining pandemic-fueled gains from 2020.\n\nThe world's largest streaming service projected it would add 2.5 million customers from January through March, less than half of the 5.9 million analysts had forecast, according to Refinitiv IBES data.\n\nNetflix tempered its growth expectations, citing the late arrival of anticipated content, such as the second season of \"Bridgerton\" and the Ryan Reynolds time-travel movie \"The Adam Project.\"\n\nShares of Netflix plummeted nearly 20% to $408.13 in after-hours trading. Competitor Walt Disney Co (DIS.N), which has staked its future on building a strong streaming business, saw its shares sink 4%.

    "text": "If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, BGR may receive an affiliate commission.\n\nEvery year, Netflix faces increased competition from rival streaming services. Disney Plus and HBO Max already boast tens of millions of subscribers each, despite how new they are. That\u2019s why Netflix has to spend so much money on new content. But the library isn\u2019t all that needs updating. Every so often, the company needs to refresh the look of its apps as well. In fact, we think we may have spotted the latest Netflix redesign before it rolls out publicly. We don\u2019t know when or if everyone will see it, but we can offer a sneak peek.\n\nDon't Miss: Tuesday\u2019s deals: Rare Apple AirTags deal, $4.49 smart plugs, Frito-Lay snacks, more\n\nToday's Top Deals\n\nCheck out the latest Netflix redesign\n\nOn Tuesday morning, our own Zach Epstein visited Netflix in his browser and discovered a fresh new look. It\u2019s a much slicker design, and offers more details about the titles:\n\nNetflix is testing a new redesign. Image source: Netflix\n\nMeanwhile, when I visit the Netflix website in my browser, this is what I see:\n\nThe current design for Netflix\u2019s website. Image source: Netflix\n\nThis seems to suggest that Netflix is testing the change with a limited number of users. The rest of us weren\u2019t able to see the redesign when we logged into our respective accounts. As with any significant change to the user interface, there\u2019s truly no telling if Netflix will decide to roll this redesign out widely. It will likely depend on how users react.\n\nThat said, it seems to be an improvement over the current design. I don\u2019t recognize all of the titles that Netflix is surfacing, so it helps to have a few descriptive keywords to give me a feel for them. As we\u2019ve noted previously, Netflix has hundreds of secret categories that it hides from view. It appears to be using these to categorize titles in the redesign. If you want to know more about the secret categories, be sure to check out our previous coverage.\n\nStory continues\n\nPrice hikes and how to avoid them\n\nIn case you weren\u2019t aware, Netflix increased the prices of all its plans in the US last month. The Basic plan, which lets you watch on one screen at a time in SD, increased from $8.99 to $9.99. The Standard plan, which lets users watch on two screens at a time in HD, increased from $13.99 to $15.49. Finally, the Premium plan, which lets you watch on four screens at once in 4K Ultra HD, increased from $17.99 to $19.99.\n\nBoth the Standard and Premium plans have nearly doubled in price since 2013. At this point, you might be thinking about canceling your service. Before you do that, you should consider changing to a cheaper plan. Here are the steps you\u2019ll need to take:\n\nSign in to your Netflix account. Under Plan Details, select Change Plan. (If you do not see Change Plan, please contact us.) Choose the desired plan, then select Continue or Update. Select Confirm Change or Confirm.\n\nIf you do decide to downgrade your plan, your billing date will stay the same, and the new price will be reflected the next time that Netflix charges you. You\u2019ll still have access to all of the features of your old plan until the next billing date.\n\nSee the original version of this article on BGR.com"

    "text": "FILE PHOTO: A smartphone with the Netflix logo lies in front of the displayed words \"Streaming service\" in this illustration\n\nNetflix earnings to set the pace for 2022 streaming wars FILE PHOTO: A smartphone with the Netflix logo lies in front of the displayed words \"Streaming service\" in this illustration\n\nBy Dawn Chmielewski and Lisa Richwine\n\nLOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Netflix Inc will be the first major streaming service to report earnings this week, offering investors a sign of whether companies have started to pull in enough new customers to justify big spending on online programming in 2022.\n\nThe dominant streaming service reports fourth-quarter results on Thursday. Wall Street will watch for how many customers Netflix picked up overseas as the pace of streaming growth levels off from torrid pandemic gains of 2020.\n\nWall Street is watching to see if the streaming wars are paying off as companies add high-profile and expensive shows such as Walt Disney Co's new reality series with the Kardashian family, a \"Lord of the Rings\" series on Amazon.com Inc's Prime Video and a \"Game of Thrones\" prequel on AT&T Inc's HBO Max.\n\nNetflix raised prices on Friday in its biggest market, the United States and Canada, where analysts say growth is stagnating. The company went on a roller coaster ride during the pandemic, with steep growth early in 2020 when people were staying home and movie theaters were closed. The rate of new sign-ups fell in 2021 as pandemic restrictions eased and COVID slowed production of new programming. The company projected 8.5 million new streaming subscribers for October to December.\n\nIn 2022, Netflix's growth is expected to stabilize, analysts say, putting it on track to return to subscriber gains logged before the pandemic. The company has new seasons of global phenomenon \"Squid Game\" and Emmy winner \"The Crown\" in the works, plus a large slate of movies.\n\nBut the streaming pioneer is confronting stiffer competition in the U.S. and abroad from new entrants, price promotions and heavy spending on exclusive content. As these subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) services invest heavily in content intensifying the \"streaming wars,\" Wall Street is beginning to question the return on this investment.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"2022 should prove that no one single company has a monopoly on great content and that time spent on any one legacy SVOD platform is not guaranteed,\" media analyst Michael Nathanson wrote in a research note.\n\nNathanson trimmed his forecasts for total Netflix streaming viewers year-end to 250 million from 252 million, citing the maturation of the U.S., Canada and Western European markets. Growth, he estimated, would come from regions in the Asia Pacific where customers pay less for Netflix.\n\nEvercore ISI analyst Mark Mahaney told Reuters that Netflix will likely continue to add a million subscribers a year in its home market, but that 90 percent of its gains will happen outside of the United States.\n\nThe competition for customers is most intense in the U.S., where the number of households subscribing to streaming service reached 78%, according to Leichtman Research, and where Deloitte estimated the churn, or rate at which people drop or subscribe to services, are averaging a relatively high 35%.\n\nPopular Netflix shows like \"Squid Game\" and the star-studded disaster film \"Don't Look Up\" will likely add around 550,000 subscribers in the U.S. and Canada in the fourth quarter, Nathanson predicts. NBCUniversal's Peacock and ViacomCBS's Paramount+ are likely to report the greatest gains in the U.S., he wrote, buoyed by National Football League and English football games, and more kids content available on Paramount+.\n\nThe contest for consumers' time and attention is also playing out across the globe, fueling aggressive spending on content. London-based researcher Ampere Analysis projects the industry-wide spending tally will exceed $230 billion this year, led by companies spending heavily on sports rights such as NBCUniversal parent Comcast Corp, at $22.7 billion, and Disney at $33 billion.\n\nNetflix, which does not air live sports, had forecast it would it would spend $17 billion on programming in 2021. It has not disclosed spending for 2022.\n\nThe Beijing Olympics and the Super Bowl will air on NBCU's Peacock service in Feburary. In addition to the Kardashians' new show, Disney will debut a Star Wars series about Obi-Wan Kenobi with Ewan McGregor reprising his role as the Jedi master.\n\n(Reporting by Lisa Richwine and Dawn Chmielewski in Los Angeles; editing by Kenneth Li and David Gregorio)"

    "title": "Netflix rocked by subscriber loss, may offer cheaper ad-supported plans",
    "publish_date": "04/20/2022",
    "text": "April 19 (Reuters) - Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) said inflation, the war in Ukraine and fierce competition contributed to a loss of subscribers for the first time in more than a decade and predicted deeper losses ahead, marking an abrupt shift in fortune for a streaming company that thrived during the pandemic.\n\nThe company said it lost 200,000 subscribers in its first quarter, falling well short of its forecast of adding 2.5 million subscribers. Suspending service in Russia after the Ukraine invasion took a toll, resulting in the loss of 700,000 members.\n\nWall Street sent Netflix's stock tumbling 26% after the bell on Tuesday and erased about $40 billion of its stock market value. Since it warned in January of weak subscriber growth, the company has lost nearly half of its value.\n\nThe lagging subscriber growth is prompting Netflix to contemplate offering a lower-priced version of the service with advertising, citing the success of similar offerings from rivals HBO Max and Disney+.\n\n\"Those who have followed Netflix know that I've been against the complexity of advertising, and a big fan of the simplicity of subscription,\" said Netflix CEO Reed Hastings. \"But, as much as I'm a fan of that, I'm a bigger fan of consumer choice.\"\n\nNetflix offered a gloomy prediction for the spring quarter, forecasting it would lose 2 million subscribers, despite the return of such hotly anticipated series as \"Stranger Things\" and \"Ozark\" and the debut of the film \"The Grey Man,\" starring Chris Evans and Ryan Gosling. Wall Street targeted 227 million for the second quarter, according to Refinitiv data.\n\nThe downdraft caught other video streaming-related stocks, with Roku (ROKU.O) dropping over 6%, Walt Disney (DIS.N) falling 5% and Warner Bros Discovery (WBD.O) down 3.5%.\n\nHastings told investors that the pandemic had \"created a lot of noise,\" making it difficult for the company to interpret the surge and ebb of its subscription business over the last two years. Now, it appears the culprit is a combination of competition and the number of accounts sharing passwords, making it harder to grow.\n\n\"When we were growing fast, it wasn't a high priority to work on,\" Hastings said of account-sharing in remarks during Netflix's investor video. \"And now we're working super hard on it.\"\n\nShare performance, paid members and net income for Netflix.\n\nCONFLUENCE OF EVENTS\n\nNetflix's first-quarter revenue grew 10% to $7.87 billion, slightly below Wall Street's forecasts. It reported per-share net earnings of $3.53, beating the Wall Street consensus of $2.89.\n\nWhile the company remains bullish on the future of streaming, it blamed its slowing growth on a number of factors, such as the rate at which consumers adopt on-demand services, a growing number of competitors and a sluggish economy.\n\n[1/3]The Netflix logo is seen on a TV remote controller in this illustration photo taken January 20, 2022. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nAccount-sharing is a longstanding practice, though Netflix is exploring ways to derive revenue from the 100 million households watching Netflix through shared accounts, including 30 million in the United States and Canada.\n\nThis confluence of factors resulted in Netflix reporting losing customers for the first time since October 2011, catching Wall Street by surprise.\n\n\"They suffered from a combination of approaching saturation, inflation, higher pricing, the war in Ukraine and competition,\" said Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter. \"I don\u2019t think any of us expected that all to happen at once.\"\n\nThe world's dominant streaming service was expected to report slowing growth, amid intense competition from established rivals like Amazon.com (AMZN.O), traditional media companies such as the Walt Disney and the newly formed Warner Bros Discovery and cash-flush newcomers like Apple Inc (AAPL.O).\n\nStreaming services spent $50 billion on new content last year, in a bid to attract or retain subscribers, according to researcher Ampere Analysis. That's a 50% increase from 2019, when many of the newer streaming services launched, signaling the quick escalation of the so-called \"streaming wars.\"\n\nNetflix noted that despite the intensifying competition, its share of TV viewing in the United States has held steady according to Nielsen, a mark of subscriber satisfaction and retention.\n\nAs growth slows in mature markets like the United States, Netflix is increasingly focused on other parts of the world and investing in local-language content.\n\n\"While hundreds of millions of homes pay for Netflix, well over half of the world's broadband homes don't yet -- representing huge future growth potential,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nBenchmark analyst Matthew Harrigan warned that the uncertain global economy \"is apt to emerge as an albatross\" for member growth and Netflix's ability to continue raising prices as competition intensifies.\n\nStreaming services are not the only form of entertainment vying for consumers' time. The latest Digital Media Trends survey from Deloitte, released in late March, revealed that Generation Z, those consumers ages 14 to 25, spend more time playing games than watching movies or television series at home, or even listening to music.\n\nThe majority of Gen Z and Millennial consumers polled said they spend more time watching user-created videos like those on TikTok and YouTube than watching films or shows on a streaming service.\n\nOne market observer said Netflix's stock has benefited from expectations of perpetual growth.\n\n\"Today's report shows that there is a limit to that long-term bullish thesis,\" said David Keller, chief market strategist at StockCharts.com.\n\nReporting by Dawn Chmielewski in Los Angeles and Tiyashi Datta in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Lisa Richwine in Los Angeles, Nivedita Balu in Bengaluru, and Noel Randewich in Oakland, Califiornia; Editing by Peter Henderson and Lisa Shumaker\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

More than a dozen analysts rushed to temper their views on a stock that has been a red-hot market performer in the past few years.\n\n\"Netflix is a poster child for what happens to growth companies when they lose their growth,\" said Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners in Pittsburgh.\n\n\"People buy growth companies because they think their cash flow is going to grow so they're paying ahead for anticipating that.

That might not be enough,\" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.\n\nNetflix's rivals already have ad-driven versions or are considering one - HBO Max offers an ad-supported subscription, while Disney+ recently said it would launch an ad-based tier.\n\n\"We're left with a business in transition. Subscribers have slowed and we struggle to see a return to a pre-COVID net add cadence,\" Piper Sandler analyst Thomas Champion said in a note.\n\nDemand for fresh and engaging content is also increasing, forcing Netflix and others to think about bigger budgets for production even as costs increase in an inflationary environment.\n\nReuters Graphics\n\nNetflix's bigger problem was consumers cancelling their subscription due to inflation and post-pandemic user fatigue, than its profitability or business model, said Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank.\n\nFor the second quarter, Netflix has lined up new seasons of popular shows 'Ozark', 'Stranger Things' and 'Grace and Frankie'.\n\nNeedham, however, took a divergent view. The brokerage upgraded its rating on the stock to \"hold\" from \"underperform\", encouraged by the company's plans to add a low-priced advertising tier.\n\nReporting by Nivedita Balu, Eva Mathews and Medha Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Sweta Singh, Saumyadeb Chakrabarty and Anil D'Silva\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

    "title": "Netflix Q1 net subscribers unexpectedly decline, revenue misses expectations",
    "publish_date": "04/19/2022",
    "text": "Netflix (NFLX) reported an unexpected decline in first-quarter net subscribers as the company navigated an exit from Russia and an increasingly saturated North American market. Shares slumped by more than 20% in after-hours trading following the report.\n\nHere were the key metrics from Netflix's quarterly report, compared to consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg:\n\nRevenue: $7.87 billion vs. $7.95 billion expected, $7.16 billion Y/Y\n\nEarnings per share: $3.53 vs. $2.91 expected, $3.75 Y/Y\n\nNet subscribers: -200,000 vs. +2.51 million expected, +3.98 million million Y/Y\n\nNetflix's drop in new users came as a surprise to Wall Street, with analysts looking for a slowdown but still positive growth in subscriptions in the first three months of 2022. Subscribers grew by nearly 4 million in the same quarter last year. In total, Netflix exited the first quarter with 221.64 million global subscribers.\n\n\"Netflix was all about subscribers for so long,\" Santosh Rao, Manhattan Venture Partners head of research, told Yahoo Finance Live Tuesday afternoon following Netflix's results. \u201cThe whole story has to be evaluated from a lower base now. And the multiples are getting compelling at this point, but we need to see that the growth story is still intact and they have a strategy to tackle the challenges ahead.\u201d\n\nFor the current quarter, Netflix said it expected an even steeper decline in new users. The streamer said it sees subscribers declining by 2 million in the fiscal second quarter, whereas consensus analysts were looking for a gain of 2.4 million.\n\n\"Our relatively high household penetration \u2014 when including the large number of households sharing accounts \u2014 combined with competition, is creating revenue growth headwinds,\" Netflix said in its letter to shareholders Tuesday afternoon. \"The big COVID boost to streaming obscured the picture until recently.\"\n\n\"While we work to reaccelerate our revenue growth \u2014 through improvements to our service and more effective monetization of multi-household sharing \u2014 we\u2019ll be holding our operating margin at around 20%,\" Netflix added. \"Key to our success has been our ability to create amazing entertainment from all around the world, present it in highly personalized ways, and win more viewing than our competitors.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nNetflix has been grappling with slowing user growth for much of the past year, with new users slowing to a trickle after a pandemic-fueled surge in sign-ups. But further exacerbating this slowdown was Netflix's exit from Russia in early March, which came following the country's invasion of Ukraine earlier this year. Netflix said in its investor letter that suspending service in Russia removed 700,000 net paid subscribers during the quarter.\n\nThe company also said it saw a contraction in subscribers in the U.S. and Canada, which combined lost a net 600,000 paying users. Earlier this year, Netflix had announced another price hike for North American viewers, which the company cited as cause for the attrition during the quarter, though it added the overall effect of the price hike was \"significantly revenue positive.\"\n\nBRAZIL - 2022/02/03: In this photo illustration, the Netflix logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Rafael Henrique/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)\n\nHeading into these results, some analysts also suggested Netflix might continue to see elevated levels of churn especially in the U.S. and Canada following these price increases. With competition mounting from the likes of Disney+, HBO Max and others newcomers, users now have more options than ever to turn to in lieu of Netflix, should they choose to end one subscription in favor of another, some said.\n\n\"Content dumps, where all episodes of a new season are delivered at the same instant, will likely keep churn high, as price conscious consumers can swap out of Netflix and shift to a competitor service after viewing the content they desire,\" Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter said in a note head of Netflix's report. \"Sustainable profit growth should continue so long as Netflix is able to continue raising subscription prices, but competition may limit future price increases.\"\n\nBut while a saturated North American market has left Netflix with relatively less runway to continue adding users, the company\u2019s international growth prospects have recently been riper by comparison. For the first quarter, Netflix added nearly 1.1 million users in its Asia Pacific geographic segment. Still, however, it also shed subscribers on net across both its Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and Latin America (LATAM) segments.\n\nAmid concerns over subscriber growth, Netflix\u2019s shares have fallen to underperform the broader market so far this year. Shares have declined by 42% for 2022-to-date through Tuesday\u2019s close, compared to an about 6% drop in the S&P 500 over that period.\n\n\u2014\n\nEmily McCormick is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Streaming giant Netflix is now facing the repercussions.\n\nThe streamer is missing out on up to $6.25 billion in annual revenue as customers flock to illegal password-sharing marketplaces, according to a recent report in the Daily Mail.\n\nThe marketplaces, such as TogetherPrice, offer access to subscriptions for as little as $1, allowing customers to share subscription costs.\n\nNow Netflix is planning to fight back.\n\nNetflix fights password sharing\n\nLast month, the streaming service rolled out a new option allowing users to add someone to their plan for as little as $2 a month. However, this deal is offered only in some countries like Chile, Costa Rica, and Peru.\n\nThe streamer started warning users last year that people should not share their passwords with people they don't live with.\n\nEarlier this year, the company also announced that it was planning on charging users who shared their passwords with people outside of their households.\n\nThe company has gotten some backlash for this warning, as back in 2017, it tweeted, \"Love is sharing a password.\"\n\nhttps://twitter.com/PoorlyAgedStuff/status/1505893301915987972?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1505893301915987972%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_u0026ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.news18.com%2Fnews%2Fbuzz%2Fnetflix-gets-roasted-for-poorly-aged-tweet-claiming-love-is-sharing-a-password-4900676.html\n\nThe root of the problem\n\nWhen the pandemic started, people started spending more time at home, turning to binge-watching shows on streaming platforms. Demand surged for streaming platforms, as consumers sought out new shows and movies to watch.\n\nNAGRA, an organization that develops digital TV standards, believes that the streaming market has become saturated, making it difficult for companies like Netflix to attract new subscribers.\n\n\"One of the behaviors we've seen is that with subscription stacking, it started to become expensive for consumers, and pirates have seen an opportunity in credential theft or credential hijacking,\" vice president of sales Ken Gerstein told the Sacramento Bee.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, according to the Advertising Research Foundation, 18- to 24-year-olds seem to be the problem. Experts suggest this could be because they have lower wages and are trying to save as much money as possible.\n\nPassword sharing has become a problem for all streaming services and could cost the industry up to $25 billion a year, according to a Citibank report.\n\nPlans getting more expensive\n\nNetflix recently hiked its subscription costs. Monthly costs for the basic plan went up by $1, while the standard and basic plans increased by $1.50 and $2, respectively.\n\nNow Netflix\u2019s cheapest plan goes for $9.99 a month. The standard plan costs $15.49 per month, and the premium plan costs $19.99.\n\nThat puts it at the higher end of streaming providers. Disney+ starts at $7.99, Prime Video starts at $8.99, Hulu starts at $6.99, and HBO Max starts at $9.99.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

The company's stock, an investor favorite during its years of rapid growth, had fallen nearly 60% this year before the earnings report.\n\n\"Thank God we're done with shrinking quarters,\" said Co-CEO Reed Hastings, adding the company needs to continue gathering momentum by focusing on content, marketing and a lower-priced plan with advertising.\n\nFrom July through September, Netflix attracted 2.4 million new subscribers worldwide, more than double what Wall Street expected.\n\n\"Netflix's impressive numbers show the company's growth story is far from over,\" said Investing.com analyst Haris Anwar.\n\nDuring the quarter, Netflix released the final episodes of season four of sci-fi hit \"Stranger Things,\" plus serial-killer series \"Dahmer - Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story,\" which became one of Netflix's most-watched series of all time.\n\nThe streaming giant is working to kick-start membership growth after a sudden decline in the first half of the year, when the company's subscriber base shrunk by 1.2 million amid a rocky global economy and growing competition for online video viewers. Netflix now has a total of 223.1 million subscribers around the world.\n\nMost established services have stopped growing in the United States, where the market has reached maturity. Newer entrants, such as Paramount Global's (PARA.O) Paramont+, are picking up market share thanks to live sports programming.\n\nIn its quarterly letter to shareholders, Netflix noted that other media companies are losing money from streaming.\n\n\"Our competitors are investing heavily to drive subscribers and engagement, but building a large, successful streaming business is hard,\" the letter said.\n\nNetflix estimated that competitors would end 2022 with combined operating losses of \"well over $10 billion,\" compared with Netflix's annual operating profit of $5 billion to $6 billion.\n\nRivals such as Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) run multiple businesses including TV networks and theme parks that offset streaming losses.\n\nFor the third quarter, Netflix topped analyst projections with revenue of $7.9 billion, up 6% from a year earlier. Earnings were $3.10 per share.\n\n[1/2]Signage at the Netflix booth is seen on the convention floor at Comic-Con International in San Diego, California, U.S., July 21, 2022.

For the fourth quarter, Netflix projected revenue of $7.8 billion, a sequential decline it blamed on the strong value of the U.S. dollar.\n\nIn early November, Netflix is launching a $7-per-month streaming plan with advertising to attract cost-conscious customers.\n\n\"We're quite confident in the long term that this will lead to a significant incremental revenue and profit stream,\" Chief Product Officer Greg Peters said.\n\nHe did not disclose how many new subscribers, or how much revenue, Netflix expects from the advertising plan.\n\nPP Foresight analyst Paolo Pescatore predicted some of Netflix's current subscribers will switch to the lower-priced option.\n\n\"Some will downgrade or decide to come back to Netflix,\" Pescatore said. \"The move is as much about retaining users as well as signing up new ones.\"\n\nAnother analyst, Wedbush's Michael Pachter, saw the ad-supported tier as a tool for to reduce cancellations by giving price-sensitive subscribers an alternative.\n\nDisney, Warner Bros Discovery (WBD.O) and other companies also offer, or plan to offer, ad-supported options.\n\nWhile Netflix is making various changes to propel growth, the company said it remained committed to producing original programming and releasing all episodes at once for binge watching.\n\n\"We believe the ability for our members to immerse themselves in a story from start to finish increases their enjoyment but also their likelihood to tell their friends,\" the company said.\n\nA new season of British royal family drama \"The Crown\" and a sequel to 2019 movie \"Knives Out\" will be released during the fourth quarter.\n\nNetflix said it would no longer provide quarterly guidance for new customers.

The company had thrived during the pandemic. It added 36.6 million customers in 2020, a record, and its aggressive investment in original content paid off in 2021 with the French crime show Lupin and the South Korean thriller Squid Game, two of its most popular programs ever. Netflix had also broken through at Hollywood\u2019s biggest awards shows, winning two of the top three Emmys and receiving 27 Oscar nominations, the most of any company. A couple of years into the streaming wars, it looked as if Netflix had not only survived but emerged stronger.\n\nCo-Chief Executive Officer Ted Sarandos , who turned Netflix into an award-winning powerhouse, took the stage to open the company\u2019s annual business review meeting after a brief sizzle reel recapping its many hits. But as soon as he ceded the stage to Spencer Wang , the vice president for finance, investor relations, and corporate development, the mood in the room began to darken, according to two people who were present but aren\u2019t authorized to talk about it. Netflix\u2019s growth had sputtered in recent months, putting the company on pace to lose subscribers for the first time since 2011. As executives followed Wang onto the stage to outline ways they could reverse the slide, many employees started to grasp that Netflix was in trouble. Its remarkable success over a 25-year history had instilled in staff a belief that it could never lose. A small DVD-by-mail service from Los Gatos, Calif., had seen into the future time and time again, outflanking much larger players to remake Hollywood in its image. This was the first time anyone could remember Netflix\u2019s leadership saying that competition was negatively affecting the company\u2019s streaming business in a significant way."

REUTERS/Bing Guan/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nLOS ANGELES, Oct 13 (Reuters) - Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) said on Thursday it will introduce a streaming plan with advertising for roughly $7 per month in November, a move to attract new subscribers after the company lost customers in the first half of the year.\n\nThe $6.99 cost for the \"Basic with Ads\" plan is $3 less than Netflix's lowest-priced tier without commercials. The new option will roll out in 12 countries including the United States, Brazil, Germany, Japan and Korea, over 10 days.\n\nSubscribers to the plan will see roughly four to five minutes of advertising per hour, Netflix said. Newly released films will have limited advertising to preserve the cinematic experience.\n\nAbout 5% to 10% of Netflix's programming will not be available on the ad-supported alternative because of licensing restrictions, Netflix Chief Operating Officer Greg Peters told reporters.\n\nShares of Netflix were up 5.4% at $232.86 in late afternoon trading. The company's stock had fallen 62% this year before Thursday's announcement.\n\nNetflix executives had adamantly opposed adding commercials to their service for years. They announced a change of heart in April when the company stunned Wall Street by shedding subscribers in the first quarter and predicting additional defections.\n\n\"We at Netflix have a huge opportunity ahead to grow our unit and to attract more subscribers. And part of that is having a wide range of pricing plans,\" Peters said on Thursday.\n\nPeters declined to estimate how many customers would sign up for the ad-supported plan or how much additional revenue Netflix might generate. The company will provide forecasts for the fourth quarter when it releases earnings on Tuesday.\n\nCowen & Co analyst John Blackledge, in a research note, said the addition of advertising offered a \"significant opportunity to unlock member growth\" among price-sensitive audiences.\n\nHe pointed to a Wall Street Journal report that Netflix had set a goal of 13.3 million ad-supported viewers in the United States by the third quarter of 2023.\n\nOther streaming services including Walt Disney Co's (DIS.N) Hulu and Disney+ and Warner Bros Discovery's (WBD.O) HBO Max already have, or plan to offer, ad-supported options that cost less. Those services charge between $8 and $10 per month for plans with commercials.\n\nNetflix, known for hits such as \"Stranger Things\" and \"Squid Game,\" reported 220.7 million paying subscribers as of June, down nearly 1.2 million from the start of the year. The company projected it would add 1 million customers in the third quarter.\n\nThe ad-supported plan from Netflix will debut in Canada and Mexico on Nov. 1, and in the United States, Brazil, United Kingdom, France, Italy, Germany, Australia, Korea and Japan on Nov 3.\n\nSpain will follow a week later on Nov. 10.\n\n\"They're very well positioned, because they're a premium brand and marketers are extremely interested in being aligned with quality content,\" said Greg Kahn, a former ad industry executive who now runs a media advisory firm.\n\nKahn predicted the new ad-supported service would likely cause some price-sensitive subscribers to opt for the cheaper tier, but added, \"There's much more potential in gaining revenue and gaining a new subscriber base.\"\n\nJeremi Gorman, Netflix\u2019s president of worldwide advertising, said Netflix nearly sold out its ad inventory for the launch of the new tier, attracting interest from automakers, consumer packaged goods companies and luxury brands.\n\nAdvertisers can target viewers by country or genre, or run commercials on the service\u2019s top 10 shows. Brands also can exclude ads from content featuring graphic violence, sex or nudity, Gorman said. Netflix also is introducing third-party verification to confirm ad impressions and traffic. Ratings agency Nielsen will also provide audience measurement, starting next year.\n\nReporting by Lisa Richwine and Dawn Chmielewski in Los Angeles Editing by Matthew Lewis\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

That alone will help drive $600 million in advertising sales in 2023 for the segment. Anmuth expects those numbers to swell by 2026 as Netflix's execution on selling ads improves.\n\nBy 2026, Anmuth thinks Netflix's US/Canada segment will boast 22 million subscribers and drive $2.65 billion in advertising sales.\n\nOptimism on Wall Street regarding the financial impact of Netflix's looming ad-tier has greatly supported the stock in recent months. Shares of the streaming giant are up 19% in the past three months, out-performing the S&P 500's 4% drop.\n\n\"Given Netflix's recently muted sub growth, advertising is critical to re-accelerating revenue, expanding Netflix's SAM [subscription addressable market], and driving greater profitability,\" explained Anmuth.\"The Netflix narrative has shifted from slow/no sub growth on the current business to advertising and paid sharing coming in 2023.\"\n\nTo Anmuth's point, the first half of 2022 has been un-Netflix like \u2014 factors that have led to the stock plunging 63% year to date.\n\nThe company shed more than one million paid subscribers in the first two quarters of the year as the economy slowed and consumers cutback. Becoming more mobile post COVID-19 pandemic has also weighed on subscriber trends for Netflix, as has been the rising of competing streaming platforms from Disney and Paramount.\n\nBut there is a real chance for Netflix to make a meaningful business by offering an ad-supported pricing tier for consumers, Cowen analyst John Blackledge says. Hence, Netflix's shares have come back alive.\n\n\"I think it will be a net-net-incremental [positive],\" Blackledge said on Yahoo Finance Live. \"It is a positive multi-year revenue [opportunity] for the company.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

    "text": "Netflix (NFLX) reported its fiscal third quarter earnings on Tuesday after the bell, crushing expectations and prompting shares to surge more than 14% in after-hours trading.\n\nHere are Netflix's third quarter results compared to Wall Street's consensus estimates, as compiled by Bloomberg:\n\nRevenue: $7.93 billion versus $7.85 billion expected\n\nAdj. earnings per share (EPS): $3.10 versus $2.22 expected\n\nSubscriber net additions: +2.41 million versus +1 million estimated\n\nIn a note to shareholders, the company said, \"After a challenging first half, we believe we\u2019re on a path to reaccelerate growth. The key is pleasing members. It\u2019s why we\u2019ve always focused on winning the competition for viewing every day. When our series and movies excite our members, they tell their friends, and then more people watch, join and stay with us.\"\n\nThe company attributed its success in the quarter to several TV and film hits, including \"Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story,\" \"Stranger Things S4,\" \"Extraordinary Attorney Woo,\" \"The Gray Man,\" and \"Purple Hearts.\"\n\nAdditionally, Netflix noted its streaming prowess relative to competitors, writing, \"Our competitors are investing heavily to drive subscribers and engagement, but building a large, successful streaming business is hard - we estimate they are all losing money, with combined 2022 operating losses well over $10 billion, vs. Netflix's $5 to $6 billion annual operating profit.\"\n\n\"Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story\" (Courtesy: Netflix)\n\nTuesday's earnings marked the first time this year the company has added subscribers, which mostly came from outside of the United States. In the first and second quarters, the company lost 200,000 and 970,000 subscribers, respectively.\n\nThe company said it will stop giving guidance on paid memberships moving forward due to its introduction of new revenue streams. For now, though, it estimated an addition of 4.5 million subscribers next quarter (above prior forecasts of 3.9 million.)\n\nStory continues\n\nTo help stem earlier subscriber losses, the company plans to launch an ad-supported subscription tier in November.\n\nMost analysts have remained bullish on the profitability aspects of the new ad tier.\n\nUBS analyst John Hodulik recently upped his price target on the stock by $52 to $250 a share, and JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth said that the ad tier's lower price point ($6.99 in the U.S.) indicates Netflix's confidence in advertising revenue.\n\nElsewhere on Wall Street, Citigroup analyst Jason Bazinet (who maintains a Buy rating on the stock) said that the upcoming ad tier \"could point to material upside\" in free cash flow, and Evercore ISI's Mark Mahaney predicted that ad-supported will bring in $1 to $2 billion in incremental revenue by 2024.\n\nOn a call prior to the ad tier announcement, Netflix Worldwide Advertising President Jeremi Gorman said the platform \"nearly sold out all of its [ad] inventory\" globally for launch \u2014 bucking the trend of a global ad spend slowdown.\n\nDespite the earnings beat, the company lowered its guidance, citing foreign exchange (FX) headwinds as the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen against most major currencies.\n\n\"Based on our YTD actuals and Q4 guidance, we estimate that this appreciation since January 1, 2022 will negatively impact our full year 2022 revenue and operating income by ~$1 billion and $0.8 billion, respectively,\" the company noted in the release.\n\nAlexandra is a Senior Entertainment and Food Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

The next phase of Netflix's months-long crackdown on password sharing \u2014 which itself follows the company's first quarterly subscriber loss in a decade \u2014 is soon upon us. The company announced during its quarterly earnings call on Tuesday that it will charge customers an added monthly fee to people who share their login credentials beginning in early 2023.\n\nThis move is an expansion of a pilot program currently running in Latin America which charges extra fees for \"extra user\" subaccounts, users outside of your immediate household who use your login to access the service. Basically, every listing on the \"Who's Watching?\" screen is going to cost you extra money if they don't also live with you.\n\nThe news comes as Netflix attempts to return to growth and settle investors after confirming it lost subscribers earlier in the year. With help from Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story and Season Four of Stranger Things, the company was able to add more than 2.4 million subscribers in its third quarter.\n\nNetflix has not yet announced pricing for the punitive charges, though if they follow the pilot program's \"one quarter of the basic rate\" scheme, it should work out to around US$3-4. For folks wanting to avoid those fees, Netflix unveiled on Monday an account migration tool that will transfer a user's subaccount data (viewing history, recommendations and the like) to their new, independent subscription.\n\nIn addition, the company recently announced a less expensive, ad-supported tier that will cost $7 a month when it launches on November 3rd. The new tier will be available in a dozen countries, including the UK, Canada, and Mexico, by November 10th."

It will initially be available to viewers in 12 countries, including the US, UK, Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, South Korea and Spain.\n\nThere are compromises beyond the commercials, which will run for an average of four to five minutes per hour. You'll be limited to a \"720p/HD\" resolution, and licensing will prevent you from watching certain movies and TV shows. Netflix says it's \"working on\" lifting that content restriction. You also can't download content to watch offline, so you'll need to pay for a Standard or Premium plan if you need viewing material for your next flight.\n\nThe ads will initially be 15- to 30-second spots, and will play both before and during shows. There will be \"broad\" targeting for those ads based on criteria like your country and the genres of content you watch. Nielsen is also tracking the performance of these ads in the US through its digital rating system.\n\nThere are still plenty of incentives to use a more expensive plan, then. However, Netflix is hopeful this will make its service accessible to a wider audience than before. To some extent, it's necessary. Netflix has been losing subscribers in recent quarters, and Basic with Ads could help either attract newcomers or keep existing users from jumping ship."

Anmuth also expects those numbers to swell to 22 million subscribers and $2.65 billion in advertising sales by 2026 as Netflix's execution on selling ads improves.\n\nBut for other pros, this rosy outlook is overdone.\n\nThat's the tone from two bearish notes from Pivotal Research and Goldman Sachs out on Tuesday. These notes, along with broader market volatility, sent Netflix shares down nearly 7% in Tuesday's trading.\n\nHere's what those analysts had to say about Netflix:\n\nGoldman Sachs Analyst Eric Sheridan\n\nRating: Sell\n\nPrice Target: $182\n\nDownside Projected: -20.8%\n\n\"Since its last earnings report, Netflix has outperformed the market... on the back of a mix of 'better than feared' subscriber losses in Q2 and growing investor optimism about the company\u2019s dual initiatives \u2014 building toward a product launch for an ad supported subscriber tier and beginning to implement a crackdown on password sharing in some overseas markets,\" Sheridan wrote. \"On the former, as we have had a number of conversations with advertising industry checks, we stand by our analysis of the opportunity set for Netflix that we first introduced in our last quarterly earnings preview as we expect a host of large scaled brand advertisers will adopt the offering but its current framework (large minimum commitment, above industry pricing and limited measurement) could cap the advertising dollar opportunity unless it evolves.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nIn addition, Sheridan warned that \"additional subscriber offerings could cause 'spin down' into the lowest priced plans by users in any potential consumer recession over the next 6-12 months.\"\n\nA man participates in a Netflix series 'Squid Game' mission at a department store in Bangkok, Thailand, November 20, 2021. REUTERS/Chalinee Thirasupa\n\nPivotal Research Analyst Jeff Wlodarczak\n\nRating: Sell\n\nPrice Target: $175\n\nDownside Projected: -23.9%\n\n\"In the end, this is not rocket science,\" Wlodarczak wrote. \"We view Netflix's move to launch an ad supported alternative as fraught with ARPU [average revenue per user], technological, financial and product risk. If Netflix were an upstart player looking to add subscribers, ad supported could be a no brainer but as the incumbent operator it seems to offer more risk than reward mainly given the existing sub repricing/results variability risk. We don\u2019t see significant subscriber acceleration in the key U.S. market from the move, beyond a potential short-term benefit, and in most international markets the ad opportunity per sub is dramatically less than in the U.S.\"\n\nAs a result, he continued, \"we view the potential transition of ultimately 40-60% of Netflix subscriber base to ad supported as a very risky endeavor which combined with increasing levels of competition (exacerbated by the fact certain players are not focused on profitability in the core streaming business) and the existing still rich valuation leads us to continue to be cautious on the stock.\"\n\nThe analyst noted one other headwind Netflix faces as streaming companies battle over subscribers.\n\n\"A last under-appreciated risk here is that Netflix management believes they can moderate the growth in content costs when virtually all of their peers are accelerating investment in content particularly on exclusive sports rights which could ultimately hit Netflix subscriber growth or push the company to reaccelerate content investment spend,\" Wlodarczak said.\n\nBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

    "text": "Netflix Inc. NFLX -1.87%decrease; red down pointing triangle is creating a $100 million global fund aimed at increasing outreach to underrepresented communities looking to work in entertainment, the streaming giant said Friday.\n\nThe Netflix Fund for Creative Equity will be distributed over five years to external organizations as well as internal initiatives at the company.\n\nNetflix didn’t say what specific organizations it would support. It previously contributed to Project Involve and Ghetto Film School, nonprofit organizations that provide fellowships and mentoring to filmmakers from diverse backgrounds.\n\nThe fund is the latest of several initiatives Netflix has launched that are aimed at boosting diversity in entertainment. Last year, the company said it would donate $5 million to organizations supporting Black artists, advocacy groups and businesses.\n\n“Doing better means establishing even more opportunities for people from underrepresented communities to have their voices heard, and purposefully closing capacity and skill gaps with training programs where they are needed,” said Netflix Co-Chief Executive and Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos in a company blog post Friday.\n\nLast June, Netflix said it would shift 2% of its cash holdings to banks and credit unions serving Black communities, while Netflix co-founder and Chairman Reed Hastings and his wife Patty Quillin are donating $120 million to Black colleges Morehouse, Spelman and the United Negro College Fund.\n\nThe attention to diversity by Netflix and other entertainment companies increased in the aftermath of the death of George Floyd while in Minneapolis police custody and the social justice protests around the country that followed.\n\nThe new Netflix fund comes on the heels of a study commissioned by the company from the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, a University of Southern California-affiliated think tank, to analyze the diversity of its content for movies and TV shows made in the U.S. The study examined 126 movies and 180 scripted series in 2018 and 2019.\n\nThe report gave Netflix high marks in terms of gender equality in its films and movies. The number of women and girls in prominent on screen roles was in sync with the population and ahead of industry trends. Behind the camera, Netflix was ahead of the rest of the industry among creators and writers and on par in terms of directors, the report said.\n\nNetflix had a strong representation of Black characters, the study said, but the streaming service came up short with LGBTQ and disabled characters.\n\nMr. Sarandos said Netflix believes increasing its efforts as well as continuing to work with USC to track their progress will create “a lasting legacy of inclusion in entertainment.”"

    "publish_date": "01/14/2022",
    "text": "Netflix Inc. raised the price for its monthly plans, the first such increase from the streaming platform since 2020.\n\nThe monthly cost for its basic plan for U.S. customers rose $1 to $9.99, while its standard plan increased to $15.49 from $13.99 and the premium plan to $19.99 from $17.99.\n\nPrices for Canadian customers also increased except for the basic plan.\n\n“We’re updating our prices so that we can continue to offer a wide variety of quality entertainment options,” a Netflix spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nThe last time the company raised the monthly prices was October 2020. That increase followed Netflix’s missing its third-quarter subscriber projections that year as more competitors entered the streaming market and the financial impact of the Covid-19 pandemic was hitting the company.\n\nThe latest increase to its monthly plans comes amid increased competition among streaming platforms and rising programming costs. Netflix is spending more on content to attract and keep subscribers as viewers have more content than ever to choose from thanks to Walt Disney Co.’s Disney+, AT&T Inc.’s HBOMax and Amazon.com Inc.’s Prime Video.\n\nNetflix’s move to raise prices in the U.S. and Canada contrasts with what it did in India. In that key market for global growth, Netflix cut its price last month to help it better compete with streaming services from Amazon and Disney.\n\nFor consumers, the higher cost for a Netflix subscription is the latest example of rising prices. Data on Wednesday showed that inflation as measured by the U.S. consumer-price index rose 7% in December, its fastest pace since 1982.\n\nNetflix is set to release its fourth-quarter results on Thursday. In October, the company said its fourth-quarter offerings would result in higher content expenses and a lower margin. Analysts polled by FactSet are expecting it to report earnings of 83 cents a share on $7.71 billion in revenue.\n\nShares of Netflix rose nearly 1.3% to $525.69 on Friday. The stock is up about 5% over the past 12 months, according to FactSet."

    "title": "Netflix Tops 200 Million Subscribers for the First Time",
    "publish_date": "01/19/2021",
    "text": "Netflix Inc. NFLX -1.93%decrease; red down pointing triangle ended last year with more than 200 million subscribers, a milestone powered by consumers left homebound by the pandemic, eager for entertainment, and rising demand in international markets where the streaming giant has a head start over many rivals.\n\nThe company said it is now able to generate more cash than it needs, and no longer anticipates having to borrow money to fuel its growth strategy. Netflix shares were up 12% in after-hours trading.\n\nNetflix’s continued subscriber growth comes amid heightened competition from new streaming services including Walt Disney Co.’s Disney+, Apple Inc.’s Apple TV+, AT&T Inc.’s HBO Max and Comcast Corp.’s Peacock, all of which weren’t around a little over a year ago.\n\nThe company got a boost from the coronavirus pandemic, which forced consumers to cut back on a host of leisure activities—from dining out and vacations to visiting theaters and concert venues—as economies locked down. With many people spending more time at home, streaming demand jumped.\n\nWhile the majority of television networks continue to be without most of their original content because of production shutdowns due to Covid-19, Netflix’s well-stocked content arsenal lifted it to new heights. Netflix signed up what it said was a record 37 million subscribers in 2020 and had a total of 203.7 million users when the year ended—more than twice as many as it had a mere three years earlier.\n\nAnd while Covid-19 continues to wreak havoc on movie and television productions, Netflix currently has more than 500 titles in post production or ready to launch on the platform, the company said. Last week, it unveiled a movie slate that will see a new release on the platform every week of 2021.\n\nNetflix creates its content much further in advance than broadcast and cable channels, which allowed the company to be better prepared to offer fresh content when the pandemic struck—something other streaming services that were still in their infancy weren’t in a position to do.\n\nAmong the strong performers for Netflix was the racy historical drama “Bridgerton,” the miniseries “The Queen’s Gambit,” a new season of “The Crown” and the George Clooney movie “Midnight Sky.”\n\nThe company already has new successes in season three of “Cobra Kai,” a show it rescued from YouTube, and the French crime drama “Lupin,” which has quickly become one the most popular programs on the platform.\n\nThe company currently anticipates 2021 cash flow at break-even, an upgrade from its earlier projection, which was minus $1 billion to break-even. Netflix said it is considering returning some cash to shareholders through stock buybacks.\n\nThe Los Gatos, Calif., company said it generated $6.64 billion in fourth-quarter revenue, up from $5.45 billion for the year earlier and thus exceeding forecasts from analysts. But profit decreased to $542 million, or $1.19 a share, from $587 million, or $1.30 a share, the year earlier. Analysts predicted $1.36 a share for the latest period, according to FactSet.\n\nFor the quarter ended Dec. 31, Netflix added more than 8.5 million subscribers on a net basis, a gain that surpassed its forecast for the period.\n\nThe bulk of the company’s growth in 2020 occurred in the first two quarters, as Covid-19 and efforts to stop its spread transformed daily life in countries around the world. Subscriber gains fell, meanwhile, year over year in the latest period, a decline the company had said it expected.\n\nNetflix sent employees a bottle of champagne and confetti to celebrate surpassing the 200 million subscriber mark, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nIn October, Netflix raised the monthly price of its most popular subscription plan, bumping up the cost of its standard streaming service, its most popular option, by $1 to $13.99. It still has a less-expensive basic offering, as well as a premium one now priced at $17.99 a month.\n\nNetflix isn’t the only streaming service benefiting from the pandemic. Disney+ is already near 90 million subscribers since its launch in November 2019. The company recently projected reaching 260 million subscribers world-wide by 2024.\n\nLike Netflix, Disney+ also raised its monthly fee by $1 to $7.99 effective March 2021.\n\nWarnerMedia’s new HBO Max streaming platform, which launched last May, hasn’t grown as fast as its rivals. However, the company recently unveiled plans to release the entire slate of Warner Bros. theatrical movies on HBO Max simultaneously in the hopes of boosting subscribers. WarnerMedia is a unit of AT&T.\n\nComcast’s streaming platform Peacock, which offers a variety of price plans including a free option, has 26 million sign-ups.\n\nThe newest entries to the streaming wars include Discovery+ from Discovery Communications Inc., which launched earlier this month, and Paramount+ from ViacomCBS Inc., which is scheduled to debut in March in the U.S., Canada and Latin America.\n\nCompetition is in part “why we have been moving so quickly to grow and further strengthen our original content library across a range of genres and nations,” Netflix said in its letter to shareholders.\n\n“Our strategy is simple: if we can continue to improve Netflix every day to better delight our members, we can be their first choice for streaming entertainment.”\n\nNetflix reported stronger subscriber growth in international markets in the fourth quarter than domestically, continuing a trend it has seen frequently of late. It added 860,000 subscriptions in the U.S. and Canada in the period, but gained two million subscribers in Asia, more than 1.2 million in Latin America and 4.5 million in the region covering Europe, the Middle East and Africa.\n\nThe company has been pushing to tap new markets abroad, including in sub-Saharan Africa, where some industry forecasters have projected content streaming to expand at a rapid clip in the coming years.\n\nNetflix also said Tuesday it expects to add another six million users in the current quarter, less than half of what it added for the same period a year ago, which saw a huge rise due to the pandemic lockdowns."

    "title": "Netflix, Facing Reality Check, Vows to Curb Its Profligate Ways",
    "publish_date": "04/21/2022",
    "text": "For Netflix Inc., the era of carefree spending is over.\n\nThe streaming giant ran up a huge bill over the past several years as it expanded across the globe and produced a mountain of programming, prioritizing growth over cost efficiency. Now the company is imposing more financial discipline, according to senior executives.\n\nThe shift comes as competition from an array of streaming rivals begins to take a toll, a new reality that was evident in first-quarter results announced Tuesday. The company lost subscribers for the first time in over a decade, and revenue grew at its slowest pace in years. Shares plunged 35%, the stock’s second-worst one-day decline ever, erasing $54 billion in market value.\n\n“Well, it’s a bitch,” Netflix Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Reed Hastings said of the results while addressing employees in a town hall on Wednesday afternoon, according to people familiar with his remarks.\n\nAfter churning out over 500 original programs last year, Netflix is looking to add fewer new titles, with a greater emphasis on quality, people familiar with the company’s strategy said. It is revamping production deals to limit its risk, and prioritizing programs with the biggest return, not the greatest reach, the people said. A key internal metric: the ratio of a program’s viewership to its budget.\n\n“We should right-size budgets depending on what the creative dictates, and what the size of the audience is,” Bela Bajaria, the head of global TV for Netflix, said in a recent interview.\n\nShe said when Netflix first started making original programs it had no track record and had to make outsize bids to land “House of Cards” and other high-profile shows. “That was the cost of entry, the cost of doing business,” Ms. Bajaria said.\n\nNetflix executives said the company expects to continue to grow spending on content to more than $20 billion this year while scrutinizing it more closely. Ms. Bajaria said that doesn’t mean the service will go cheap on production. “We’re always going to make great shows and have the amount of money needed for the creator’s vision,” she said.\n\nAs it looks to rein in costs, Netflix is also exploring new ways to boost revenue. In January, the company said it was raising prices in the U.S. and Canada. On Tuesday’s earnings call, Mr. Hastings said Netflix is exploring adding a lower-priced, ad-supported version of the service to court cost-conscious viewers. And, after blaming password-sharing for limiting its growth, Netflix says it is looking to “monetize” the practice.\n\nThe newfound focus on content costs is causing tensions with Hollywood’s producers and show runners, who have benefited from the streamer’s largess. Netflix’s tendency to give shows a quick hook when it believes they aren’t delivering a return is another sore spot with producers and creators. Some producers say Netflix needs to be more aware of its competitive environment, and factor in the programming rivals are launching when deciding when to release its own shows.\n\n“If there is anything I would say is a fault of Netflix, it is that they are so insular. They may not see what’s going on outside their walls or they know and the hubris is so great they don’t care,” said Jeff Fierson, whose credits for Netflix include the movie “Sweet Girl” and the short-lived series “Daybreak.”\n\nMr. Fierson noted that “Daybreak”—a show about teens in a post-apocalyptic Los Angeles—made its debut close to the premiere of Disney+’s “The Mandalorian” and the debut of the Apple TV+ streaming service.\n\nWarning sign\nNetflix still leads the pack in streaming video with more than 220 million subscribers. But its recent turbulence has rattled Wall Street, causing investors to question how big the pot of gold is in the streaming wars. Shares in Paramount Global, which operates the Paramount+ streaming service, fell 7% on Wednesday, while shares in Walt Disney Co., owner of Disney+, fell 5% and shares in Warner Bros. Discovery, owner of HBO Max, fell 5%\n\nDisney+, Netflix’s closest rival with 130 million subscribers globally, is starting to feel some pressure as well. The company launched a low-cost, ad-supported tier to boost subscribers. It is broadening beyond the “Star Wars” and “Marvel” programming that has anchored Disney+, hoping to reach new audiences and be better positioned to achieve its target of between 230 million and 260 million subscribers by the fall of 2024. The ABC show “Dancing with the Stars,” which appeals primarily to an older audience, will move exclusively to Disney+ starting this fall.\nAll streaming players are learning that adding new subscribers is getting much harder, especially in the mature U.S. market. Every service is under pressure to create a steady flow of new shows and movies to draw in new subscribers and retain existing ones. The hope is that every once in a while they’ll score a big hit like Netflix did with “Squid Game,” “Tiger King” and “Queen’s Gambit.”\n\nVeteran media analyst Michael Nathanson, who has raised concerns about the prospects for major players in streaming, said consolidation that reduces the number of competitors might relieve some pressure, but “for the time being, this is a pretty capital-intensive business.”\n\nSome producers and writers say they are frustrated by inconsistent guidance from streaming services, which are always looking for a new formula to attract more subscribers. “As creative people we are getting whipsawed. There is not a mission statement that sticks around for more than a couple of months,” said producer Mike Royce, whose credits include the Netflix reboot of “One Day at a Time.”\n\nWhen Netflix first introduced original programming to its platform a decade ago, its pitch to creators was that there would be little interference from the “suits” and no worries about ratings. In recent years the company has spent hundreds of millions of dollars signing superstar producers including Shonda Rhimes and Ryan Murphy, setting off a talent arms race among Hollywood studios.\n\nNow, the service has a never-ending conveyor belt of new content. Shows have a window of several weeks to find their audience or they are canceled, meaning they usually aren’t promoted on the home page and become harder for viewers to find. Netflix executives say the company’s cancellation rate is on par with that of rival streamers, and of broadcast and cable networks.\n\nProducers say the short window for shows to prove themselves is unrealistic. A recent show that fell victim to a quick hook was “Cowboy Bebop,” a bounty-hunter drama based on a popular Japanese animated series. Netflix spent heavily on the show, betting it would appeal to the same audience that loved the hit show “Squid Game.”\n\nThe streaming giant was so confident it ordered a second season before the first one had even made its debut. But just five weeks after “Cowboy Bebop” premiered on Nov. 19, Netflix pulled the plug. It simply wasn’t gaining traction fast enough. The cancellation left the show’s producers dumbfounded, according to a person close to the show.\n\n“We always take big risks and big swings and sometimes, you know, many times they work and sometimes they don’t,” Ms. Bajaria said of Netflix’s expensive misses. “It’s a creative endeavor and it’s not a science.”\n\nReturn on investment\nSometimes, even coming out of the gate strong isn’t enough. The sci-fi drama “Archive 81” landed in Netflix’s ranking of top-ten shows in the U.S. soon after its January debut, even reaching No. 1 briefly. Two months later it was canceled.\n\nShows that Netflix spent heavily on, and which aren’t resonating, will be canceled quickly. That was the case with last year’s sci-fi drama “Jupiter’s Legacy” and the spy series “Hit and Run,” which were each canceled after about a month on the service.\n\nThe holy grail for Netflix is to find shows like “Squid Game” that are inexpensive and yet become hits. “Virgin River,” at a cost of roughly $3 million per episode, is a relatively low-budget soap opera with no big stars, but has been a huge success for Netflix. That means it is more efficient than pop-culture hit “Bridgerton,” which costs more than three times as much, say people familiar with the streamer’s efficiency measurement.\n\nUnder-the-radar, relatively low-cost hits are necessary to balance out the costs for big-ticket programming such as the special-effects-filled show “Stranger Things,” whose new season has a per-episode cost of $30 million, according to people close to the show.\n\nNetflix also places a high value on shows that appeal to less-frequent users of the service, who are the most in danger of canceling their subscription, compared with heavy users, company executives said.\n\nNetflix is looking to lower its costs when licensing shows it doesn’t own from outside studios and production companies. One studio executive with multiple shows at the streamer said in some cases Netflix is looking to reduce budgets on new shows by as much as 25%.\n\nIn addition, Netflix is seeking to change the formula it uses to license content. Typically, Netflix pays a premium to outside suppliers above the cost of production in return for having long-term rights to a show or movie. That premium has usually been a percentage of a show’s budget ranging between 20% and as much as 35%.\n\nNow Netflix is seeking to shift to a flat fee model for those premiums so they don’t rise if a show’s production budget goes up.\n\nNetflix is also re-evaluating the big production contracts it has made to star producers to make shows exclusively for their service as the streamer’s results with such deals have been mixed, talent agents said.\n\nCertain genres of programming have fallen out of favor at Netflix. The company has moved away from talk shows and musicals, after they failed to perform, executives said. By contrast, the company is investing in more documentaries and unscripted fare, which are cost-efficient and tend to perform well.\n\nPlots and scripts\nIn Hollywood, Netflix has been known for giving creators a long leash. Now, the company expects to be more hands-on in the development of shows and movies, weighing in on scripts and plot points, company executives said.\n\nThose practices are standard at traditional networks and studios. “Having more development is an evolution of the maturity of the business,” said Ms. Bajaria, who before joining Netflix in 2016 was a top executive at Comcast Corp.’s NBCUniversal.\n\nProducers say Netflix is also lowering costs by reducing the number of episodes it orders for shows for their second and third seasons. The second season of the dark comedy “Russian Doll” has one less episode. The coming season of “Firefly Lane,” a drama about two lifelong friends, is likely to have two fewer than its first season, people close to the show said.\n\nMs. Bajaria said shorter episode orders are “always about the creative” and not economics.\n\nAnother area where Netflix is tinkering is scheduling. The streamer recently hired Andy Kubitz, a former ABC and CBS programming executive, to the newly created position of “director of programming and launch analytics.”\n\nNetflix doesn’t plan on making any dramatic changes to its custom of releasing a season’s worth of episodes at once. Other streamers have opted for a more traditional approach of spreading out the release of episodes so they can build buzz, a strategy some producers wish Netflix would embrace.\n\n“There are so few Netflix shows that get what [producer] David Kelley used to call water cooler treatment—you know, where he’d have an episode of ‘Ally McBeal’ and people would talk about it the next day,” said Marty Adelstein, chief executive of Tomorrow Studios. He predicted Netflix will eventually shift to a model of releasing three episodes at a time.\n\nMs. Bajaria said the company’s approach of allowing full-season binges is about customer freedom. “I still think that our members, by and large, want to watch what they want, as many as they want, when they want,” she said."

    "publish_date": "04/20/2022",
    "text": "Netflix Inc. NFLX -1.88%decrease; red down pointing triangle shares fell 35.1% on Wednesday, recording their worst day since 2004, after the streaming giant reported that it lost subscribers in the first quarter.   \n\nWilliam Ackman, the billionaire investor whose fund bought more than three million shares of Netflix in January, said Wednesday that the fund had sold its stake at a loss. In a letter to investors, Mr. Ackman said Netflix would reduce returns at the fund, Pershing Square, by four percentage points. That implies a loss of around $400 million.\n\nIn January, Mr. Ackman said Netflix sported an “attractive valuation”; on Wednesday he wrote, “We have lost confidence in our ability to predict the company’s future prospects.”\n\nThe shares shed more than a third of their value, finishing down $122.42 to $226.19. The stock was the S&P 500’s worst performer of the day. Investors had expected that the company would add new users in the quarter. Instead, Netflix said it ended the first three months of the year with 200,000 fewer subscribers than it had in the fourth quarter and said it expected to lose two million global subscribers in the current quarter.\n\nSeveral other streaming stocks fell Wednesday. Paramount Global finished down $3.12, or 8.6%, to $33.16, and Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. was off $1.48, or 6%, to $23.01. Walt Disney Co. retreated $7.33, or 5.6%, to $124.57, while Spotify Technology SA lost $14.92, or 11%, to $122.49.\n\nThe fall in Netflix’s shares represented its biggest single-day percentage drop since Oct. 15, 2004, when it fell 41% after saying it would cut subscription fees and postpone planned international expansion. It slashed $54.3 billion from the company’s market capitalization, its largest one-day market cap loss on record. \n\nIt is the second time the shares have tumbled this year. In January, Netflix shares slid more than 20% when the company said it expected to add a much smaller number of subscribers than it did one year prior. The stock is down 62% this year including Wednesday’s fall.\n\nUsers flocked to Netflix in the initial months of the coronavirus pandemic as lockdowns and measures to contain the virus kept people at home, sending the company’s share price to record highs. Easing of restrictions and an increase in competition from other streaming services over the past year have presented hurdles to Netflix’s growth.\n\nNobody was expecting Netflix to announce they lost subscribers. They were expecting a slowdown in subscriptions, but seeing Netflix losing subscribers is a big deal,” said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, an online broker.\n\nMore than 100 million Netflix shares traded hands on Wednesday, the first time it had crossed that milestone since 2015, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Some individual traders appeared to be buying the dip: The company was by far the most-purchased stock on Fidelity’s brokerage platform, according to the firm’s website. Buy orders for the stock far outpaced the number of sell orders tied to the shares.\n\nMeanwhile, options trading volumes tied to the stock exploded on Wednesday, with around 15 times the activity seen on a typical day, according to Cboe Global Markets data. Many traders appeared to be positioning for a steeper fall in the shares, or to profit from a continued downturn. Put options that would pay out if the shares sank to $200 or $190 were among the most widely traded. Ahead of the earnings report, call options that would profit if the shares rallied were popular.\n\nTraders shelled out around $2 billion for Netflix options as of afternoon trading, in what is known as premium, surpassing what they spent on options tied to Amazon.com Inc. or an exchange-traded fund tied to the S&P 500, according to data provider Shift Search by Vesica Technologies.\n\nNetflix is one of the original FANG stocks, a quartet of large internet companies that reflect the dominance of technology stocks on U.S. markets. The others are Facebook-owner Meta Platforms Inc., Amazon and Google-owner Alphabet Inc. Some analysts also include Apple Inc. Cracks have emerged in the popular trade this year and analysts have said that they have reconsidered their approach to trading the technology heavyweights after some disappointing earnings.\n\nNetflix said it is exploring offering a lower priced ad-supported version of the platform to boost its subscriber base, a shift for a company that has sold itself since its inception as a commercial-free haven for its members. The company had increased its subscription fee earlier this year.\n\nThe growing number of streaming options has made consumers more price-sensitive. Netflix is among the few major streaming services that has yet to entertain offering a cheaper, ad-supported option. Disney’s Hulu has long done so, while Warner Bros. Discovery’s HBO Max and Disney+ have also pushed into ad-supported streaming.\n\nThe step adds to investor worries that rising prices will curtail consumer spending on nonessential goods and services\n\n“People are asking ‘Is this worth it?’” Ms. Ozkardeskaya said. “As prices rise, the worth threshold is being pulled higher and that’s pushing people to the exit.”\n\nThe company’s results also attracted the attention of Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk, who has made a $43 billion bid to buy Twitter Inc.\n\n“The woke mind virus is making Netflix unwatchable,” he tweeted Tuesday night in response to a news article about the subscriber losses."

    "text": "Netflix Inc. NFLX -1.91%decrease; red down pointing triangle said it is exploring offering a lower priced ad-supported version of the platform to boost its subscriber base, after the streaming giant posted its first quarterly subscriber loss in more than a decade.\n\nThe move is a significant change for a company that has sold itself since its inception as a commercial-free haven for its members. Netflix is grappling with slowing revenue growth caused by stiffer competition from rival services and rampant account sharing among its customers.\n\nIn a Tuesday analyst interview to discuss the company’s first quarter-results, Netflix Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Reed Hastings said an ad-supported version of Netflix makes a lot of sense.\n\n“Those who have followed Netflix know that I’ve been against the complexity of advertising and a big fan of the simplicity of subscription,” Mr. Hastings said. “But as much as I’m a fan of that, I’m a bigger fan of consumer choice.”\n\nNetflix earlier in the day said it ended the first quarter with 200,000 fewer subscribers than it had in the fourth, missing on its own projection of adding 2.5 million customers in the period. Netflix said it expected to lose two million global subscribers in the current quarter.\n\nNetflix shares were 25% lower in after-hours trading. Through Tuesday’s close, the stock has declined by more than 40% so far this year.\n\nThe company blamed password sharing among its members and increased streaming competition for pressuring revenue growth. Netflix estimated that besides its almost 222 million paying households, the service is being shared with an additional 100 million homes including 30 million in the U.S. and Canada.\n\nIn its letter to investors, Netflix said it is testing password-sharing subscription models that it believes will allow it to monetize sharing and build revenue. Mr. Hastings said password sharing combined with competition “is what we think is driving the lower acquisition and lower growth.” He added that when Netflix was growing fast, trying to reduce password sharing “wasn’t a high priority to be working on.”\n\nThe streaming company said revenue growth has slowed considerably after years of 20%-plus gains. Revenue in the first quarter rose roughly 10% to $7.87 billion, below analysts’ projections of $7.93 billion.\n\nNetflix warned that gains made during the Covid-19 pandemic hid the fault lines that have emerged in its business over the past few years. “Covid clouded the picture by significantly increasing our growth in 2020, leading us to believe that most of our slowing growth in 2021 was due to the Covid pull forward,” the company said in its letter.\n\nWith a rate of growth that has been the envy of the industry for more than a decade, Netflix has long been seen as a barometer for streaming, and any challenges it faces might have broader implications for its rivals.\n\nNetflix’s subscription decline brought its paid global subscriber base to 221.6 million, down from 221.8 million in the prior quarter. Net profit was $1.6 billion, down from $1.71 billion a year earlier.\n\nBesides competition and password sharing, Netflix said slowing growth reflected such factors as the rate of adoption of smart TVs, data costs and world events including increasing inflation, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and continuing disruption from the pandemic.\n\nNetflix said shutting down its service in Russia resulted in the loss of 700,000 subscribers.\n\nAs competition grew and programming costs rose, the company moved recently to raise the price for its monthly plans for the first time since 2020.\n\nReferring to Netflix’s performance, Mr. Hastings said, “What we gotta do is take it up a notch” to “get back in our investors’ good graces.”\n\nThe growing number of streaming options has made consumers more price- sensitive. Netflix is among the few major streaming services that had yet to entertain offering a cheaper, ad-supported option. Walt Disney Co.’s Hulu has long done so, while Warner Bros. Discovery Inc.’s HBO Max and Disney+ have also pushed into ad-supported streaming.\n\nNetflix’s first-quarter operating margin was 25.1%, down from 27.4% a year earlier. The company said it aims to keep its operating margin at 20% in the future.\n\nNetflix said its plan to right itself will be heavily focused on improving the quality of its programming and the recommendations that platform provides to its customers to keep them engaged in the content and on the service. Netflix already spends more than any other entertainment provider, with a programming budget that is expected to surpass $20 billion this year.\n\nAlthough Netflix has several hit shows including “Stranger Things,” “Bridgerton” and “The Crown,” the service has also had its fair share of expensive flops recently including “Jupiter’s Legacy” and “Space Force.”\n\n“We need to have an ‘Adam Project’ and a ‘Bridgerton’ every month,” said Co-Chief Executive and Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos during the analyst interview.\n\nWorld-wide, Netflix said its business in Central and Eastern Europe showed the effects of Russia’s attack on Ukraine. Also down was Latin America, which lost 400,000 subscribers. In the U.S. and Canada, the company lost 600,000 subscribers, which it attributed to its recent price increase.\n\nThe company said it had grown in Japan, India, the Philippines, Thailand and Taiwan.\n\n“Over the longer term, much of our growth will come from outside the U.S.,” Netflix said."

    "title": "Netflix’s Password Crackdown Is Coming. Here’s What That Means for Account Sharers",
    "publish_date": "04/21/2022",
    "text": "People using Netflix NFLX -1.93%decrease; red down pointing triangle accounts that aren’t your own, the company is on to you. “We’re working on how to monetize sharing,” Netflix Chief Executive Reed Hastings said Tuesday during the company’s earnings call. \n\nTranslation: Get your own subscription, password moochers.\n\nRemember that time you lent your co-worker your login to watch “Stranger Things?” And your dog groomer’s sister? You’re not alone. Nearly 222 million households pay for Netflix, but the company estimates an additional 100 million homes access the service through password sharing. \n\nPreventing password sharers wasn’t a big priority when Netflix was adding new subscribers every month. Now, as Netflix records a rare drop in subscribers and its stock price, the practice is hurting the streamer’s bottom line, and it has been testing ways to get freeloaders to pay up. Netflix rolled out a payment structure for extra users in some countries in Latin America, and said it could take at least a year to launch a similar system in the U.S. \n\nFor years, many services have turned a blind eye to password sharing. The lack of enforcement is, in part, why it is so common. Some apps tout features that let multiple users stream at the same time from different devices, and allow users to maintain multiple profiles on their account. There are limits, though, and apps can block people from watching when there are too many users at once.\n\nHere’s what to know about account sharing on Netflix and other streaming services, and how you—and your account moocher—might be affected by the coming password crackdown.\n\nNetflix’s Plan\nCurrently, each Netflix account can host profiles for up to five people in a household. In other words, five people can share the same login with separate viewing history, content preferences and recommendations. \n\nA Netflix spokeswoman said the company defines a household as people who live together, and allows two simultaneous streams for subscribers to the $15.49-a-month Standard plan, and four on the $19.99-a-month Premium plan. The Basic subscription ($9.99 monthly) allows streaming on only one screen at a time. The company in January raised prices across its plans but said Tuesday that it is exploring a cheaper option with ads.  \n\nWhen a device outside the household logs on, Netflix may ask the primary account owner to verify the device—such as a Roku streaming stick or iPad—to ensure that it is authorized to do so. The company said it uses IP addresses, device identifiers and account activity to determine whether devices are within a household.\n\nIn the earnings call, Chief Operating Officer Greg Peters said the company intends to ask people sharing their accounts with users outside their home—think kids at college or relatives nearby—to pay up. \n\n“If you’ve got a sister, let’s say, that’s living in a different city and you want to share Netflix with her, that’s great,” he said. “But we’re going to ask you to pay a bit more, so she gets the benefit and the value of that service, but we also get the value of the revenue associated with that viewing.”\n\nNetflix is testing a monetization model in Chile, Costa Rica and Peru that lets subscribers add extra members they don’t live with at a price lower than a stand-alone subscription. The extra members get their own login credentials. In Costa Rica, the feature costs $2.99 a month, while users in Chile and Peru are charged the local equivalent.\n\nThe program likely will undergo about a year of testing, Mr. Peters said, before launching globally.\n\nLast year, Netflix asked some of its users to verify their identity through a text message. A spokesman said it was to ensure the devices were authorized and The Wall Street Journal reported that Netflix hadn’t cut off any subscribers for sharing a password, according to a person close to the company. \n\nOther popular streaming services take a similar approach, but allow a different number of profiles and simultaneous streams. So far, Netflix has been the most vocal about the effects of password sharing. \n\n"

    "text": "Netflix Inc. NFLX -2.00%decrease; red down pointing triangle is rolling out an ad-supported tier of service in a dozen countries as it continues talks with major studios, capping a seven-month sprint between the streaming giant’s announcement about entering the ad business and the product’s debut.\n\nThe Los Gatos, Calif., company has so far secured big-name advertisers for its initial launch and hired new senior ad industry executives to help develop its business, but it continues to haggle with several major studios for the right to run ads against their content in the new service or put their content on the ad tier, according to people familiar with the matter. The service is scheduled to launch Thursday in the U.S.\n\nThe launch of the company’s ad-supported tier of service, called “Basic with Ads,” comes a month before rival Disney+ starts its first ad-backed plan and as Netflix tries to boost subscriber growth and revenue after a tumultuous 2022. New ad-backed plans are important elements of a push within the streaming industry to make more revenue per subscriber by offering lower-cost plans that let consumers pay less in exchange for watching ads.\n\nAmong the studios with whom Netflix hasn’t yet finalized revised licensing agreements are Walt Disney Co., Comcast Corp.’s CMCSA -1.18%decrease; red down pointing triangle NBCUniversal, Sony Pictures Television, Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. and Lions Gate Entertainment Corp., LGF.B -2.21%decrease; red down pointing triangle people familiar with the negotiations said.\n\nDisney makes no original content for Netflix, but it provides reruns of popular shows including “Grey’s Anatomy” and “How to Get Away with Murder.” NBCUniversal is a big supplier of original and library content to Netflix, including the drama “You.”\n\nTalks also continue with Sony Pictures Television, which makes “The Crown” and “Cobra Kai” and sells its theatrical movies and reruns of “Breaking Bad” to the streamer. Production companies closer to a deal with Netflix include Warner Bros., which makes original shows for and sells library content to the streamer, and they expect to reach an agreement, the people said.\n\nIt is unclear what content from outside suppliers will be missing from the new service. Whether Netflix has the right to insert ads or include content on an ad-supported tier depends on the terms of its initial licensing agreements with studios. Netflix has said the tier will include content representing 85% to 90% of viewing on its platform, but it hasn’t spelled out what percent of its library that represents.\n\nThe new Netflix plan will cost $6.99 in the U.S. and will include four to five minutes of ads per hour of content, the company said this past month. It plans to take a “crawl, walk, run” approach to entering the ad market, executives have said, which means ad formats and its approach to ad sales will evolve over time.\n\nWhile Netflix had been asking top dollar for brands to advertise on its ad-supported service, the ad prices some brands will pay have dropped after negotiations with media buyers, people familiar with the discussions say. Some brands have been reluctant to pay a steep premium for an unproven platform that isn’t offering sophisticated ad targeting, they said.\n\nNetflix had been seeking to charge advertisers roughly $65 for reaching 1,000 viewers, but some advertisers have ended up paying between roughly $45 to $55 for ad time, ad buyers said.\n\nIt isn’t unusual for new entrants in the streaming space to seek high prices and then have buyers negotiate them lower. And ad costs can range wildly depending on the amount a particular brand spends, placement or how much the advertiser’s buyer commits to spend on an ad service.\n\nAd industry executives expect Netflix to be able to charge more if it improves its ad-targeting capabilities and grows the ad tier’s subscriber base. The company plans to collect users’ birthdays and gender and use that information for ad-targeting over a longer term. Netflix has secured higher ad rates for special placement, some ad buyers said.\n\nAmong the advertisers that plan to run ads on the service are luxury brand LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, people familiar with the matter said, along with beauty brands L’Oréal and Nyx. Netflix told analysts in late October that it was turning away some advertisers because it couldn’t accommodate all of the demand with the launch.\n\nNetflix partnered with Microsoft Corp. MSFT -0.74%decrease; red down pointing triangle to sell its early stage ad inventory and tapped two former Snap Inc. executives—Jeremi Gorman, president of worldwide advertising, and Peter Naylor, vice president of ad sales—to build out the business.\n\nMadison Avenue has embraced Netflix’s new ad team, which is having an impact on negotiations, some of the ad buyers said. The duo threw a party during Advertising Week in New York this past month where deep-pocketed ad buyers hobnobbed with Netflix executives at the company’s office in the Flatiron neighborhood of Manhattan.\n\nNetflix is continuing to bring in new talent to fill out its team, including measurement expert Julie DeTraglia, who was formerly head of strategy and research for Amazon Sports and will be vice president, ads measurement strategy, the company said Tuesday. Adam Gerber, formerly executive director of U.S. investment at GroupM, is also joining as senior director, client development, Netflix said.\n\nThe tier’s debut is a test of whether a lower-cost plan will draw new subscribers that so far were put off by existing price tiers, and if the ad-supported plan will steal customers from more expensive plan levels. Netflix has said customers don’t typically move between its existing service tiers and that while it expects some users to shift from its basic plan to the “basic with ads” level, it will have a neutral or positive impact on revenue.\n\nAmong current Netflix subscribers, middle- and lower-income users as well as older customers are more interested in shifting to an ad-supported tier than younger audiences, a survey of 1,300 current Netflix subscribers by Samba TV between August and September found.\n\nElsewhere, some 23% of gross new subscriber additions to HBO Max’s ad-supported plan in September were people who switched from its ad-free tier, according to streaming service data provider Antenna."

    "title": "Netflix’s Ad-Supported Plan Will Launch in November at $6.99 a Month",
    "publish_date": "10/13/2022",
    "text": "Netflix Inc. NFLX -1.91%decrease; red down pointing triangle will charge $6.99 a month for its new ad-supported tier of service when it debuts next month, the company said Thursday, releasing the plan a month before the launch of Disney+’s ad-backed streaming tier and for one dollar less.\n\nNetflix said the new tier, called “Basic with Ads,” will initially be available in 12 countries including the U.S., U.K., Canada, Germany, Japan, Brazil and Australia, though it plans to launch more broadly over time. The ad-supported tier will launch in those initial markets globally in stages between Nov. 1 and 10, the company said.\n\nThe launch, seven months after Netflix said it would enter the ad business, shows the urgency with which the streaming giant is trying to attract new customers and improve its average revenue per user. The company reported back-to-back quarters of subscriber losses in the first and second quarters and is scheduled to announce its performance for the September quarter on Oct. 18.\n\nGreg Peters, Netflix’s chief operating officer, said existing subscribers would remain in their current plan at the same price. If existing subscribers want to transition to the ad-supported plan, they can make the change within their account settings.\n\nWalt Disney Co., meanwhile, plans to raise the price of its basic Disney+ plan from $7.99 to $10.99 in December, and those who don’t wish to pay more will start seeing ads.\n\nNetflix’s basic ad-free plan costs $9.99 a month in the U.S. The company also has plans that cost $15.49 and $19.99 a month with varying degrees of simultaneous-viewing limits and better-quality streams. Netflix’s ad-supported tier will have lower resolution for viewers than the $15.49 and $19.99 tiers but will still be high definition.\n\nNetflix’s foray into the ad business does carry risks, including the possibility that a large portion of users decides to pay less in exchange for viewing ads, which would cannibalize its subscriber base.\n\nMr. Peters declined to say what portion of Netflix’s existing subscribers the company expects to switch to the ad-backed tier, but he said he expected revenue from ad-tier subscribers to be the same or greater than it is from the comparable ad-free plan.\n\n“We’re not trying to steer people to one plan or the other,” he said. Netflix expects some switching from ad-free tiers to the ad-backed plan, as well as a lot of new users joining or rejoining the service. That will help make the tier attractive for advertisers because they will be able to reach large audiences, he said.\n\nNot all of Netflix’s vast library will appear on the ad-backed service, the company said, because of licensing restrictions that it continues to work on. Users also won’t be able to download content as they can on other tiers of service.\n\nThe plan will display four to five minutes of ads an hour and ads will typically be 15 seconds or 30 seconds long, playing before and during content. The company said it has nearly sold out its ad inventory at launch.\n\nNetflix is offering advertisers the ability to target ads broadly based on country and genres like romance, science fiction and action, and letting brands opt out of advertising alongside sexual or graphically violent content, the company said.\n\nThe streaming giant will collect the date of birth and gender of ad-tier subscribers, more information than it currently asks customers for, and will eventually use that information for ad targeting over time, said Jeremi Gorman, Netflix’s new president of worldwide advertising.\n\nNetflix said it has forged verification partnerships with DoubleVerify Holdings Inc. and Integral Ad Science Holding Corp. to confirm the validity of views, and is working with Nielsen Holdings PLC to help advertisers measure the audiences that saw ads.\n\nThe company has raced to learn and enter the ad business after years of saying that Netflix would remain a commercial-free platform. Many advertisers have said they are eager to run campaigns on Netflix because it will help them reach new audiences that spend hours binge-watching TV shows and movies."

    "title": "Netflix Gains 2.4 Million New Subscribers, Reversing Trend",
    "publish_date": "10/18/2022",
    "text": "Netflix Inc. NFLX -1.92%decrease; red down pointing triangle snapped back to subscriber growth in the third quarter, giving the streaming giant a jolt as it works to execute two major strategic shifts aimed at bolstering its revenue and subscriber base.\n\nThe company added 2.4 million new subscribers in the September quarter, after having forecast a net gain of 1 million customers. The subscriber growth followed back-to-back quarters of customer defections that raised questions about Netflix’s ability to expand its user base amid increased competition. \n\n“Thank God we’re done with shrinking quarters,” co-Chief Executive Reed Hastings said on the company’s earnings call Tuesday. Executives said Netflix had good momentum, but had to continue to work to spur greater revenue growth. \n\nThe company’s shares rose 14% in after-hours trading following the results. As of Tuesday, Netflix’s stock was down about 60% so far this year.\n\nThe size of Netflix’s quarterly subscriber additions remained small by historical standards. Netflix had attracted 4.4 million new customers in the third quarter of last year, and the 8.3 million it added in the fourth quarter of 2021 is nearly twice as big as the 4.5 million the company expects to gain in the final period of 2022. Netflix had 223 million subscribers at the end of September.\n\nAll companies in the streaming business are facing profound competition and struggling to add new subscribers, which makes it more important to ensure that they are generating as much revenue as possible from their viewers.  \n\nIn its letter to investors, Netflix said it was starting to see some of its competitors raise prices and others rein in content spending. “While it’s early days, we’re starting to see this increased profit focus,” across the industry, Netflix said in its letter. “Our best estimate is that all of these competitors are losing money on streaming,” said Netflix, which is profitable. The company said it had a competitive advantage over rivals because it focuses solely on streaming.\n\nNetflix is in the process of executing two major strategic shifts in an effort to increase its revenue and subscriber base. The first is rolling out its first tier of ad-supported content, which will help increase the average revenue per subscriber Netflix brings in. Last week, Netflix said it plans to begin launching the tier next month and would charge $6.99 a month for it. Netflix said it expects the ad tier to provide significant revenue and profit, and noted it had received strong interest from advertisers so far.\n\nThe second is cracking down on password sharing and getting viewers who are sharing accounts to pay to do so. The company has tested different approaches to getting households to pay more to share and said it plans to roll out a sharing policy in 2023.\n\nNetflix said Tuesday it would make it easier for people who share Netflix accounts to create “sub-accounts” or “extra members” if they wish to pay for family or friends on their accounts. It said it plans to roll that feature out in early 2023. Earlier this week, the company said customers globally can now export their viewing profiles to new accounts without losing their preferences, watch lists and viewing history—which can make the decision for account sharers to get their own account easier.\n\nNetflix added members in each region for which it reports results during the September quarter, adding 104,000 new customers in the U.S. and Canada, with its strongest growth again coming from Asia, where it added 1.43 million new subscribers during the quarter. Its customer base in Europe, the Middle East and Africa grew to become larger than the U.S. and Canada for the first time, though North America remains its biggest market by revenue.\n\nNetflix’s revenue grew 5.9% to $7.93 billion, while net profit fell 3.5% to $1.4 billion. \n\nThe company’s operating margin fell to 19.3% from 23.5% a year earlier, a change Netflix attributed almost entirely to the U.S. dollar’s appreciation relative to other currencies. The foreign-exchange impact is expected to weigh further on the company’s operating margin in the fourth quarter: Netflix expects it to be 4.2%, compared with 8.2% a year earlier. That final quarter is one in which Netflix traditionally spends more on content and marketing. \n\nWhile Netflix for years enjoyed being one of a few available streaming services, it is now one of roughly a dozen mainstream offerings, and there are many more niche services that are vying for viewing time as well. It also contends with platforms like Google-owned YouTube and TikTok for viewers’ time.\n\nThe flexibility that streaming services have long offered consumers—allowing them to pay monthly and turn off services as they please—differentiated them from cable’s long-term, inflexible contracts. But they also made it easier for customers to turn services on and off when they finished watching a specific hit show or movie.\n\nThe rate of customer defections across premium streaming services rose to 5.7% in August, according to subscription research firm Antenna, up from 4.9% a year earlier. Some 20% of subscribers to premium services—a group that includes Netflix, Walt Disney Co.’s Disney+, Disney-controlled Hulu, Apple Inc.’s AppleTV+ and Warner Bros. Discovery Inc.’s HBO Max, among others—canceled three or more subscriptions in the two years up to August, Antenna data show.\n\n“The best way to reduce churn is to keep them entertained,” Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said on Netflix’s earnings call. He added that Netflix was getting better at ensuring that it is regularly delivering popular content.  \n\nBetween July and September, Netflix released a number of popular shows, including the second set of “Stranger Things: Season 4” episodes, “Dahmer—Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story,” the fourth season of “Virgin River” and the fifth season of “Cobra Kai,” as well as films including the “The Gray Man,” “The Sea Beast” and “Purple Hearts.”\n\nNon-English language programming that drew large audiences during the quarter included the South Korean series “Extraordinary Attorney Woo” and thriller “Loving Adults” from Denmark. Mr. Sarandos said “Extraordinary Attorney Woo” was an example of content from international markets becoming popular around the world.\n\nNetflix plans to release the fifth season of hit TV show “The Crown” in the final quarter of the year, as well as films like whodunit “Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery” and “The Good Nurse,” a thriller starring Oscar-winners Jessica Chastain and Eddie Redmayne.\n\nAbout a year since it launched videogames on its platform, Netflix said it would take several years to learn what gamers like, though said it was seeing some encouraging signs. The company said it has 55 more games in development in addition to 35 games on its service."

    "title": "Netflix Seeks Ways to Get Subscribers to Return After Visits Decline",
    "publish_date": "10/17/2022",
    "text": "Netflix Inc. NFLX -1.97%decrease; red down pointing triangle earlier this year saw a worrying signal in its data: Users were coming to the streaming service less often, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nThe company, which tracks how many days over a four-week period its members watch content on the service, was concerned that the decline in visits would make it more likely that customers would cancel their subscriptions, the people said.\n\nFollowing that finding, co-Chief Executive Reed Hastings called on staff to find ways to make subscribers visit the platform more frequently, particularly as viewers re-establish their commuting, travel and entertainment habits after the worst of the pandemic, they said.\n\nThe mission to improve visit frequency is part of a broader effort by the company to better assess the value of content that sits somewhere between a smash hit and a flop, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nOver the past two years, that overarching effort included measuring whether a specific program is deemed “sticky”—if it was watched for at least 75 minutes over the course of 28 days—and giving users more tools to identify content they really like, such as a double thumbs-up, people familiar with the effort said. Now, the company is looking more closely at stickiness in concert with how frequently members return to the service.\n\nNetflix declined to comment.\n\nThe company’s growing emphasis on such metrics for making programming decisions comes as Netflix has lost subscribers for two consecutive quarters, something that had never happened before in the streaming pioneer’s history. Netflix has told investors it expects to add 1 million subscribers in the third quarter. It is scheduled to report results for the period on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nNetflix’s shares are down about 60% so far this year.\n\nAdding more urgency to Netflix’s efforts to have customers spend more time on its platform is the November launch of its first ad-supported tier, given that the revenue the company can expect to generate from ads will depend on how many people see them.\n\nNetflix experienced a large influx of new customers in the early days of the pandemic, when lockdowns left many people with more time to watch shows such as “Tiger King.” That trend waned as life started getting back to normal, Netflix raised its prices in the U.S. earlier this year and upstart streaming rivals including Walt Disney Co.’s Disney+ and Warner Bros. Discovery Inc.’s HBO Max expanded their subscriber bases.\n\n“There are just way more places to put my eyeballs and my dollars,” said Evan Shapiro, a producer and adjunct media professor at Fordham University and New York University.\n\nNetflix—whose executives used to boast that the service only competed with sleep—now finds itself competing not only with streaming rivals, but with apps such as TikTok and YouTube that are hugely popular among young people.\n\nAn internal brand health tracker that regularly surveys consumers about their perception of Netflix showed that young and diverse audiences’ view of the company was flagging, people familiar with that finding said.\n\nNetflix ascended to the dominant spot in streaming with the help of its laser focus on continually finding new ways to measure success. One way Netflix has tried to stoke more regular and prolonged viewing over the past year is by helping subscribers give more feedback on their preferences and diversifying the recommendations they receive.\n\nFor example, Mr. Hastings advocated for a new feature rolled out earlier this year that lets viewers give content a double thumbs-up when they loved it, adding to an existing thumbs-up and thumbs-down system, people familiar with that effort said. Those signals—and others, like what viewers add to their watch list—help feed the recommendation algorithm with richer data to improve the suggestions Netflix makes, they said.\n\nNow, if a show or movie gets a statistically significant amount of double-thumbs-up ratings, it will get a so-called “double thumbs up bonus,” which feeds another metric used to determine whether that content was a good investment, some of the people said.\n\nThe company is also considering refining the metric that tracks how many days a month people use the platform to account for people who visit it multiple times a day, particularly as households establish new commutes and routines, they said. That effort is complicated by the fact that many households use Netflix through one main account instead of setting up individual profiles. On top of that, some users share passwords with friends and distant family members, another issue that Netflix has vowed to tackle.\n\nNetflix used to rely on a fairly basic method of measuring audiences: Anyone who had watched a movie or show for at least two minutes was counted as a viewer. By that metric, Gaspar Noé’s movie “Love” was highly successful because of its opening ten-minute sex scene, which was the subject of broad social-media chatter during the pandemic in 2020, some of the people familiar with the matter said. A lot of viewers—known internally as “starters”—tuned in to begin watching it.\n\nLast year, Netflix dropped the two-minute metric for its public rankings and instead started to rank content by total hours viewed. By that new metric, shows such as “Dahmer—Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story” have been big hits. It drew more than 700 million hours of viewing since its late-September release, making it Netflix’s second-most popular English-language TV show after “Stranger Things: Season 4.”\n\nThe company is also exploring changes to its “surprise me” feature, which recommends something completely different from a person’s past viewing preferences, the people familiar with the matter said. As a result of one potential change, users would be asked to choose the genre of the surprise content that would be recommended, they said.\n\nWedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said the efforts indicate that Netflix is getting closer to hitting a subscriber ceiling.\n\n“They can no longer rely on adding 20 million new subscribers,” he said. “So they have to focus on not losing 20 million subscribers.”"
